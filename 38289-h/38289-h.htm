<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>


<p><i>All his life Sa'-zada the Keeper had lived with
animals. That was why he could talk to them, and
they to him; that was why he knew that something
must be done to keep his animal friends from fretting
themselves to death during the dreadful heat
that came like a disease over their part of the
Greater City.</i></p>

<p><i>In the Greater City itself the sun smote with a
fierceness that was like the anger of evil gods. The
air vibrated with palpitating white heat, and the
shadows were as the blue flame of a forge. Men
and women stole from ovened streets, wide-mouthed,
to places where trees swayed and waters
babbled feebly of a cooler rest; even the children
were sent away that they might not die of fevered
blood.</i></p>

<p><i>But in the Animal City there was no escape.
The Dwellers from distant deep jungles and tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
forests had only blistering iron bars between them
and the sirocco that swept from the brick walls of
the Greater City.</i></p>

<p><i>It was because of this that Sa'-zada said, "I
must make them talk of their other life, lest they
die of this."</i></p>

<p><i>In the Greater City men thought only of themselves;
but with Sa'-zada it was different. The
animals were his children&mdash;his friends; so he had
contrived that all of the Peace-kind&mdash;the Grass-feeders
and others&mdash;should come from their cages
and corrals and meet each evening in front of the
iron-bound homes which contained those of the
Blood-kind, to tell stories of their past life.</i></p>

<p><i>Sa'-zada had asked Hathi, the one-tusked Elephant,
who had been Ganesh in Hindustan, about
it. In Hathi's opinion those who had seen the least,
and were of little interest, would do all the talking&mdash;that
was his experience of jungle life; so the
Keeper had wisely arranged that each evening
some one animal, or group, should tell the tale.</i></p>

<h2><a name="FIRST_NIGHT" id="FIRST_NIGHT"></a><big>FIRST NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORIES OF WHITE, YELLOW, AND BLACK LEOPARD</h2>


<p>Through the listless leaves of the oaks and
elms the moon was spraying silver over
the hot earth when Sa'-zada, throwing down bars
and unlocking gates, passed the words to his friends
to gather at Leopard's cage.</p>

<p>As he slipped the chain from Hathi's foot, and
it fell with a soft clink on the hay bed, he said,
"Ganesh, you of the one tusk, keep thou the Jungle
Dwellers in order, for if one may judge from the
manners of one's own kind, who are men, this
weather is a breeder of evil tempers."</p>

<p>"Umph, umph!" grunted Hathi complacently.
"I who have seen fifty such times of discomfort
think little of it. Surely the Sahib-kind, who are
also long dwellers, can remember that there comes
another season of cool. But, as you say, Master,
perhaps it were well if I take into my trunk a
cooler of water for such as may fret themselves
into a fever."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Even as Hathi spoke an angry roar shook the
building they were in.</p>

<p>"Hear that, Patient One," cried Sa'-zada; "Pardus,
the Black Panther, who is at best a mighty
cross chap, is in an evil way."</p>

<p>The cry of Black Panther, which was like the
falling of many cataracts, was causing the dead
night air to tremble. "Hough-hough; a-hough!
Huzo-or, Wah-hough!"</p>

<p>"There, make haste, Little One!" said the
Keeper to Elephant. "The sight of our friends
who are gathering at his cage, has put Pardus in a
temper, I fear."</p>

<p>In front of the Leopard's house all the outside
animals of the Park had assembled: Arna, the
India Buffalo; Sher Abi, the Crocodile; Gidar, the
Jackal, and many others; even Magh, the Ourang-Outang,
was there with a Fox Terrier who lived
in her cage.</p>

<p>"Friends," began Sa'-zada, "if we are all to live
here together in this Park, it were well that we
know of each other's ways."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," declared Sher Abi; "for
in my time I have known little of the habits of
other animals. A dog, for instance, will come
down to the water to drink&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," interrupted Gidar; "and not having
the wisdom of a Jungle Dweller like me, he will
come to drink and stop to sup with one of your
kind. Is that not so, Sher Abi?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps, perhaps," sighed the Magar; "and
at home the Pups, having lost a parent, fall into
the clutches of Gidar the Jackal."</p>

<p>"I like this meeting," broke in Magh; "a gathering
of thieves, and cannibals, and murderers&mdash;Eaters
of Dogs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Apes," came like a soft summer sigh from
the bellows-mouth of the Crocodile.</p>

<p>"Friends," interrupted the Keeper, "do not fall
to quarreling. Let us decide who is to tell the first
tale. As we are at Leopard's cage, perhaps he
should have the first chance."</p>

<p>"I'm agreed," declared Magh; "murder stories
are always interesting."</p>

<p>"I am sure everybody would be glad to hear
of your killing, Magh," sneered Pardus.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Sa'-zada, "here are three
Leopards: Pard, the Black Leopard; Rufous, the
Yellow Leopard, and White Leopard. We'll have
their stories for this evening."</p>

<p>"I'm no Leopard," objected Pardus, ceasing his
restless walk for a minute. Then he took three
turns up and down in front of the bars, his big
velvet feet sounding "spufh, spufh," on the hard
polished floor. "No," he continued, stopping in
front of Sa'-zada, sitting down, and letting his big
round head sink between his shoulders, until he
looked up from under heavy brows with yellow-green
eyes, "no, I'm a Panther. That is the way
with the men of my land; to them we are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
'Chita,' or else 'Bagh,' which surely means a
Tiger."</p>

<p>"I know," answered Sa'-zada, "you are neither
Bagh the Tiger, nor Chita the Leopard."</p>

<p>"I should say not," answered Pardus. "Chita
is long of leg and slim of gut&mdash;a chaser of Rabbits,
and of the build of an Afghan Hound. With one
crunch of my jaws&mdash;Waugh! Why, I could break
his neck."</p>

<p>"What's the difference, anyway," objected
Magh, "whether you are a Leopard or Panther&mdash;you
all belong to the family of Throat Cutters?
But what bothers me is that one is black, one is
yellow, and one is white; now, in my family, we
are all of one shade."</p>

<p>"A very dirty color, too," sneered Pardus.
"Waugh-hough! no color at all&mdash;just <i>dirt</i>!"</p>

<p>"That is so that murderers like you cannot see
me to eat me," answered Magh. "If I am on
the ground, am I not the color of the ground?
And when I am curled up on the limb of a tree
am I not like a knot on the tree trunk? That is
to keep me safe from you and Python."</p>

<p>"That may be so," answered Pardus, "but I,
who hunt in the early night, find this black coat the
very thing. Soft Paws! I have come so close to
a Bullock, working up wind, of course, that one
spring completed the Kill."</p>

<p>"Umph, umph!" grunted Hathi, with eager interest.
"All that appears reasonable; but, tell me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Brothers, why is Yellow Leopard so bright in his
spots? And if your black coat serves you so well,
how does the other, who is white, manage?"</p>

<p>"I speak only of myself," joined in Rufous, the
Yellow Leopard. "True, I also hunt at night at
times, but it's slow work; perhaps a long night
watch by a water pool, and then only the kill of a
Chinkara&mdash;a mouthful, and in the time of scarce
food, why, one must stalk when the Grass-feeders
are within range of one's eye. Who is there
amongst you all, even Soor (Wild Boar), with his
sharp Pig eyes, that can say, when I am crouched
amongst the bushes with the sun making bright
spots all over the jungle, 'There is Yellow Leopard,
who is a slayer.' Not only is it good for the Kill,
this coat of mine, but when the hunt is on from the
other side, when I seek to keep clear of the Men-kind&mdash;by
my caution! more than once, when it has
been that way, have I slipped quietly through the
young jungle, and left the Beaters running up
against each other, asking which way went Bagh.
I am no night prowler like Pardus, for often have
I killed in the open."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of all this matter," declared
White Leopard; "but had I been black like Pardus,
or black-spotted like Rufous, I had died of a lean
stomach in the white mountains from which I come.
Why, there, on the hillside, every rock gleams
white in the sunlight&mdash;not spotted, mind you, for
there is no jungle such as Rufous speaks of; even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the sand-hills are so white with the hot light that a
mate of mine has been almost at my side before I
knew it."</p>

<p>"White Leopard is from the <i>Safed Kho</i> Mountains,
the White Range, in Afghanistan," said
Sa'-zada for the information of the others.</p>

<p>"I know," declared Unt the Camel; "I've been
there&mdash;just the loveliest hot sandy hills and plains
in the whole world. But, tell me, Little Brother of
the Blood-kind," he bubbled, "it is not always sunlight
there&mdash;at times the white storm comes&mdash;high
up in the range&mdash;what do you do then?"</p>

<p>"My coat gets whiter still," answered Leopard;
"and if I close my eyes and stalk by scent alone,
why, you would never see me till I was at your
throat."</p>

<p>"It's either a lie or most curious truth," grunted
Magh, biting the Fox Terrier's ear till he squealed.
"Here is a Pup that is white all the time, and no
lies about it, either."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's the truth," asserted Wapoos, the Hare;
"in the winter time I, also, turn white to save my
throat from Lynx or Marten; though it is not of
my own doing, to be sure."</p>

<p>"It's Wie-sak-ke-chack, who is God of all Animals,
who arranges it this way," said Mooswa,
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Well," interrupted Sa'-zada, "one of you
Leopards tell us of the manner of your coming
here."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"As I have said," began White Leopard, "I
was born in the Safed Mountains, and it was a
year of much hunger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The very year I was born," declared Magh;
"there hardly seemed more than three nuts or berries
in the world."</p>

<p>"Come up here, Chatterbox," grunted Hathi,
winding his trunk around Magh's body, and lifting
her to his massive head.</p>

<p>"Let me hold the Pup," whined Sher Abi,
spreading his shark mouth in a disinterested yawn.
Hathi blew a handful of small stones which he had
been picking up, into the opening, causing Sher Abi
to sputter and choke. When the laughter had subsided,
White Leopard proceeded with his story.</p>

<p>"As I have said, it was a year of much hunger,
because the Affrides made war, and the Sahibs
came, and it seemed as though everything that had
life in it was driven out of the country. They ate
up the Goats and Sheep, and the Bullocks and
Camels they took to carry their loads. It was
indeed a time of distressed stomachs; and, to make
matters worse, my Father, who was a killer of
Bullocks and not a Goat eater, dropped the matter
of a thousand feet over a cliff and was killed. Then
my mother came with me, and I was still a Cub,
down to the land of the Marris, where there were
many Sheep&mdash;the short-legged kind with the broad
fat tails; small they were, to be sure, and hardly of
the bulk of even a Cub's desire. The very sweetness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of their flesh made one wish that they had
grown larger. Hunger pains! but it was a long
tramp on a lean stomach, and in the end we fell
among Men thieves&mdash;those of the White-kind, the
Sahibs."</p>

<p>"Birds of a feather on one limb," sneered Magh,
tickling Hathi on the ear with her sharp finger.</p>

<p>"And in that land, though there were many
Sheep, it was hard to make a kill. Why, the Herd
Men, Pathans they were called, which I think
means the greatest of all thieves, were as wary as
Jungle Dwellers. At the first try my Mother got
a blow in the shoulder from one of their evil, long-necked
Firesticks."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Sa'-zada; "that long gun
was a <i>jezail</i>, and the Pathans are good marksmen,
too. I could tell a story myself of their shooting;
but go on, Chita, it's your say."</p>

<p>"As for making a kill at night, Waugh! we had
near starved watching for a chance; these Hillmen
huddled their Sheep and Goats into caves like
children, and slept across the opening.</p>

<p>"And do you know, Friends, they lived so close
with their Sheep, that I swear by my mustache they
were of the same smell. Fine as my scent is, one
night I had crept close to what my nose told me was
a Sheep, and was just on the point of taking it by
the neck when it got up on its hind legs and roared
at me with the man cry.</p>

<p>"We were like to die of hunger when Jaruk the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Hyena came sneaking and laughing, and talked
of a blood compact to Rani, who was my Mother.
We were so hungry! but it was all to our undoing;
for the grinning sneak was a coward, and led us
into an evil trap. He told us of three Sahibs, a
short journey from where we had our hunt; and
these Sahibs were like Cubs in their little knowledge
of jungle ways, having Sheep and Goats
which they tied to stakes close by the white caves
in which they lived, and never a guard over them
at night. Waugh! well I remember, hungry as I
was, how the smell of Hyena fair turned my stomach,
so that I had little longing for eating of any
kind; but Rani, being older and having more wisdom,
knew that unless we soon found some method
for making a kill we should surely die.</p>

<p>"That night there was a small moon as we crept
down over the valley and up to a flat-land where
the Men-kind lived in little white caves&mdash;such odd
caves, too, in one place to-day and in another the
next."</p>

<p>"He means tents," explained Sa'-zada; "being a
Cave Dweller himself, his knowledge of houses is
limited."</p>

<p>"It's a wonder he didn't call them trees," muttered
Magh.</p>

<p>"Hyena stole along like a shadow of nothing, so
smooth and soft were his feet&mdash;a proper sneak, I
must say I thought him even then, Cub as I was."</p>

<p>"Are you listening, Jaruk?" called Magh, maliciously;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
"this was a Brother of yours who was in
partnership with Chita."</p>

<p>But Hyena only grinned a frothy laugh, and
slunk over behind Sher Abi.</p>

<p>"Well," proceeded White Leopard, "we crept
along, our bellies close to earth, till we came to a
little ledge, where Rani and I waited, while Jaruk
stole up to the white caves to see how the stalk was.</p>

<p>"'They sleep like the young of Owls in daytime,'
he whispered when he returned; 'even I,
who am a creature of fear, and not like you, Rani,
a slayer of Bullocks, have rubbed my lean jaws
against two fat Goats that are chewing the sweet
cud of plenty.'"</p>

<p>"How your mouth must have watered, White
Shirt," sneered Magh.</p>

<p>"Then Rani commenced the stalk, and I, even a
Cub, though I had always lain hidden while she
was making the kill before, followed close at her
heels. Even now I remember just how Rani made
the kill. First one paw, and then the other, she
stretched out, and pulled herself along, with never
so much as the rattle of a single stone. The Goats
were like the Sahibs in the caves, safe in the conceit
which comes of a full stomach. When Rani
crouched lower than ever and braced her hind paws
carefully, I knew that the charge was on. Waugh,
waugh-houk! By the neck she had one&mdash;for that
is the way of our kind always&mdash;and with a jerk he
was thrown on her shoulder, and away up the hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
she raced. I tried for the other, but, being new to
the kill, missed, getting only the rope in my teeth.
Even as I chased after Rani I could not help but
laugh in spite of my miss, for Hyena was screaming
as he ran, 'Did you get the fat one, the very
fat one?'"</p>

<p>"The Greedy Pig," commented Magh.</p>

<p>"Ugh, ugh, ugh!" grunted Soor. "Why should
he be likened to one of my kind? More like he had
a paunch full of peanuts, or other filth, such as you
carry, Miss Bleary-eye; or if he were greedy, was
he not like unto his mate, Chita, who will eat half
his own weight at a single kill?"</p>

<p>"Such a row I never heard in all my life," continued
White Leopard; "the Sahibs, and the black
men who serve them, ran here and there with
blinking red eyes in their hands&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Man Fire," quietly commented Mooswa.</p>

<p>"And all at once, over to one side, there was a
short growl from a Firestick; and a Sahib called
loudly, 'I've got him! I've got him!'</p>

<p>"I wondered what it could be, for Rani and I
were together with the Goat. I almost hoped it
was Jaruk; but he was close at our heels, sniffing
with his hungry nose, and fairly eating the sand
where some of the Goat's blood had trickled into it.
Then all the blinking red eyes passed swiftly to
where the Sahib was, and we heard them laughing&mdash;only
louder than Hyena laughs.</p>

<p>"Next day Jaruk discovered that the Sahib had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
killed the other Goat with his Firestick in the dark,
thinking it was Rani.</p>

<p>"Of course, one Goat did not keep the hunger
off very long; but for three days we did not make
another kill. Not but that we tried. Each night
we went close to the white caves, and Jaruk&mdash;I
must say he had a nose like a Vulture's eye&mdash;came
back with a tale that the Sahibs were watching with
their Firesticks. But the next night we got another
Goat. Cunning Animals! but Jaruk used to laugh,
and even coaxed Rani to make a kill of one of the
Men-kind.</p>

<p>"Then one night we crept as before, close for a
kill, and Jaruk came back to us laughing as though
there wasn't a Sahib in all the Marri country. Rani
growled at him for a fool. Waugh-houk! did he
mean to have us all killed with his noise? And
who was to do the killing, Jaruk asked mockingly,
for the white caves were empty, he said. The
Sahibs, and even the black-faced kind, had all gone
away, and left the Goats and Sheep for the pleasure
of our kill.</p>

<p>"'It's a Raji (war), I'm sure,' he said; 'and
they have gone out amongst the Pathans to kill and
be killed, and while they are at it we, who are possessed
of a great hunger, will make a kill of the
Goats and Sheep.'</p>

<p>"At this we went more boldly than before; but
it was only a trap. These of the Men-kind whom
we had likened to young Owls, were up on the hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
behind a stone sangar; and just as we came to the
Goats in the bright moonlight there was such a
crashing of Firesticks, and appearing of what
Mooswa calls the Man Fire, that I hope I may
never see it again. Rani was killed, as also was&mdash;which
was not so bad&mdash;Jaruk the Hyena. I had a
paw broken, which to this day makes me go lame.</p>

<p>"Then the Men-kind rushed down, and the
black-faced ones were for killing me also; but one
of the Sahibs, speaking, said: 'This is a Cub. We
will send him to Sa'-zada.'"</p>

<p>White Leopard ceased speaking, and Sa'-zada,
putting his hand in between the bars, patted
his paw, and said: "Poor old Chita! it may not
be so nice here as in your own land, but we'll
see that you do not go hungry, anyway. Now,
Rufous, my big Yellow Leopard, you should
also have an interesting account of yourself to
give."</p>

<p>"Quite likely," exclaimed Magh; "we'll hear
some more rare boasting, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>"A true tale is no boast," said Mooswa, solemnly.
"I, who have had strange adventures,
think it no harm to talk them over."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll have a chance, Fat Nose!" retorted
Magh; "but first let us have a good, hearty lie
from Leopard."</p>

<p>"There will be no lies," declared Sa'-zada, "for
I have all these matters in The Book&mdash;though they
are not half so interestingly written, I must say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
as you can tell them yourselves, if you are so
minded."</p>

<p>"Phrut!" muttered Hathi through his big trunk.
"We'll have the lies as spice&mdash;that will be when
Magh's turn comes."</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Yellow Leopard commenced:
"I came from a jungle land&mdash;Burma."</p>

<p>"My home," muttered Hathi, longingly.</p>

<p>"It may have been the year White Chita
speaks of, for I remember I was also wondrous
hungry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You always are," sneered Magh.</p>

<p>"Because I have not a paunch that holds a thief's
load, whether it be fish, fruit or filth," retorted
Rufous. "But, as I was saying when this Goat-faced
Ape interrupted me, I was hungry, and,
walking through the thick jungle, discovered a
Bullock&mdash;young, of great fatness. By a rare
chance it seemed caught in a branch of the elephant
creeper&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Elephant what?" muttered Hathi. "Not of
our kind. We have naught to do with the killing
of any young."</p>

<p>Sa'-zada explained: "Yellow Leopard means the
giant jungle vine called 'elephant creeper,' which
runs for perhaps the length of a mile, and is so
strong that it pulls down great trees and smothers
them in its grasp."</p>

<p>"Oh, jungle wood," cried Hathi, much relieved,
"that's an elephant of another color."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shikarried the small Bullock most carefully,"
continued Rufous. "Round and round I went, taking
the wind from every quarter; there was the
scent of nothing but the white jasmine, and the
yellow-hearted champac. When he saw me the
Bullock-young became stupid with much fear; the
two of us stood facing each other. He pulled back
tight on the thing that held him, watching me with
eyes that seemed as big as the black spots on my
ears. I crept closer, and closer, and closer; for
that is always the way with my kind; whether the
prey be small or great, we kill after the same manner
always. Brothers, know you aught of fear?
We of the Blood-kind know it well. The Bullock's
legs shivered like leaves that tremble in the wind;
and he asked me with his big eyes to go away and
not take him by the throat for his blood. How
did he know that, Brothers&mdash;how did he know that
I was not coming like one of his own kind to help
him in his trouble? And the fear that I speak of
was in his eyes.</p>

<p>"With a roar, Waugh-hough! I charged full at
him; my strong jaws fastened on his throat, and,
with a quick turn upwards, I threw him on his
back, and his neck was broken. Ghu-r-r-r-h!
Whur-r-r-h! his young blood was sweet as it
trickled into my jaws, for I was so hungry. Not
that I drank his blood&mdash;that is a lie of the Men-kind
who know little of our ways."</p>

<p>"They're all alike," chattered Magh; "they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
murder, and it is all right because they are
hungry."</p>

<p>"Yes," retorted Yellow Leopard, "if I alone
made a kill perhaps that would be wrong; but we
are all alike&mdash;it is our way of life. You are an evil-looking,
flea-covered, pot-bellied Monkey, but your
kind are all alike, so that is also your excuse."</p>

<p>Hathi shoved the tip of his trunk in his mouth,
pretending to pick his teeth, but really to smother
the laughter that fairly shook his huge sides.</p>

<p>"By a find of much eating!" ejaculated Gidar.
"How I wish I had been with you, Killer of Cattle.
A whole Bullock! Eating of the choicest kind for
three days at least. Often for the length of that
time have I searched through a famine-stricken
village in my native land, and in the end achieved
nothing, in the matter of food, but a pot of hot
rice water thrown on my back by a Boberchie
(cook)&mdash;an opium-eating stealer of his Master's
goods."</p>

<p>"Would that you had been in my place," sneered
Yellow Leopard, "for even as I was going away
with my kill&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Squee-squee-squee!" interrupted Magh with a
sneering laugh. "Even I, who am a Tree Dweller
of little knowledge, knew that a tale from this
Cut-throat would soon run into a lie of great
strength. May I kiss the Tiger if I believe that
Chita carried away a young Bullock."</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>"You are wrong, Magh," reproved Sa'-zada;
"in my hunting days have I seen even Bhainsa, the
tame Buffalo, who is like unto a small Elephant,
carried a full half-mile by Bagh."</p>

<p>"Yes," asserted Yellow Leopard, "had the
kill been an Ape like unto Magh, I had bolted
it at one mouthful lest the sight of it made me
ill. As I was saying, I took the young Bullock
in my mouth, but at the first step my forepaw
was lifted by something of great strength. I was
surprised, for I had seen nothing&mdash;nothing but
the kill. The thing that had me by the paw
was of a fiendish kind. Jungle-wisdom! but I
was at a loss. Dropping my prey I tried first
this way and then that to break away, but it
gave with me every time, and when I was tired
lifted me to my hind legs, for the pull was always
upward."</p>

<p>"Was it a Naht?" queried Hathi. "One of the
Burmese jungle Spirits that live in the Leppan
Tree?"</p>

<p>"You were snared," declared Sa'-zada; "I know,
I've seen it. A strong green bamboo bent down,
the snare fastened to it, and once over your paw&mdash;no
wonder you were on your hind legs most of the
time like a dancing Dervish."</p>

<p>"Why did you not bite it off?" queried Wolf.</p>

<p>"Neither would you," answered Leopard;
"though I tried. The evil-minded Men seemed to
know just what I would do, and had put a big
loose bamboo over the cord. It was always down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
against my paw, and simply whirled about from
my teeth."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you trumpet?" asked Elephant.</p>

<p>"I haven't a bugle nose like you, Brother; but
I roared till the jungle shook in fear&mdash;even at the
risk of bringing about me the Jungle Dogs, who
hunt in packs, as you all know."</p>

<p>"Whee-ugh!" whined Boar; "Baola, the mad
kind. Nothing can stand against them. When
they drive, the jungle is swept clean. Better to die
in peace than make a noise and be torn to pieces
by their ugly fangs."</p>

<p>"And who came?" queried Magh. "I suppose
you were like the Bullock, and your eyes grew big
with the fear, and you begged them to go away and
not hurt you. It was all right when you were to
make the kill yourself&mdash;it was fine sport. Bah!
I'm glad you were snared&mdash;I hate a taker of life."</p>

<p>"The Men-kind came," answered Leopard
meekly, for the mention of his fear made him
abashed; "and seeing that I was caught, a Sahib
would not let the Black-Men kill me, but set them
to make a strong Bamboo cage. I was put in that
and sent here to Sa'-zada."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," began Mooswa, plaintively.</p>

<p>"Well, now!" exclaimed Magh; "I thought you
were asleep, Old Heavy-eye. If you think with
your nose, your thoughts must have been of great
importance."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Mooswa sniffed solemnly and continued: "You
said you were hungry, Yellow Leopard. Was it
not a land of much good feeding?"</p>

<p>"It was a bad year&mdash;a year of starvation," answered
Chita. "Up to that time the way of my
life had been smooth, for I had found the manner
of an easy kill. To be sure, Soor is not the pick of
all good food&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Soor,' indeed!" grunted Wild Boar. "Ugh,
ugh, ugh! by the length of my tusks you would
have found me tough eating."</p>

<p>"You see," continued Chita, paying no attention
to this interruption, "the wild Pigs were horrid
thieves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were well mated," mumbled Magh, stuffing
a handful of peanut shells in Hathi's ear.</p>

<p>"They used to go at night to the rice fields of
the poor natives, and chew and chew, and grunt,
and row amongst themselves, until the Men-kind
were nearly ruined because of their greediness."</p>

<p>"But they did not eat the natives," objected
Boar.</p>

<p>"Neither did I," protested Chita&mdash;"while the
Pigs lasted," he muttered to himself. "Knowing
of all this, I made out a new kill-plan. At the first
beginning of dark time I would go quietly down
to the rice fields, hide myself in the straw that was
near to the place where the Men-kind tramped the
grain from its stalk with Buffalo, and wait for the
coming of the rice thieves. Soon one dark shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
would slip from the jungle, then another, and another,
until they were many.</p>

<p>"'Chop, chop, chop!' I'd hear their wet mouths
going in the rice; and all the time growling and
whining amongst themselves because of the labor
it was, and for fear that one had better chance than
another; not in peace, but with many rows, striking
sideways at each other with their coarse, ugly
heads."</p>

<p>"You're a beauty!" commented Wild Boar.
"When you shove your ugly face up to the bars
the women-kind scream, and jump back&mdash;I've noticed
that."</p>

<p>"Presently," continued Chita, "one would come
my way, seeing the great pile of straw, and I'd have
him. Jungle Dwellers! how he'd squeal; and his
mates would scurry away jinking and bounding
like Kakur Deer. Cowardly swine they were.
Now, Buffalo, when one of my kind charged them,
would throw themselves together like men of the
war-kind, and stand shoulder to shoulder."</p>

<p>"Yes; but, great Cat," objected Boar, "you took
care to seize upon a young one, I warrant. Suppose
you come out here and try a charge with me.
Ugh, ugh! I'll soon slit up your lean sides with
my sharp tusks."</p>

<p>"Be still!" commanded Sa'-zada; "here we are
all friends, and this is but a tale of what has been."</p>

<p>Chita had turned in a rage at Boar's taunt, and
glared through the bars, his great fangs bared, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
tail lashing his sides. When the Keeper spoke he
snarled in disdain at the bristling Pig, and continued
the story.</p>

<p>"Then came the hungry year. At the turning of
the monsoons there should have been rain, but no
rain came. All through the cold weather the
jungle had gone on drying up, and the grass turned
brown, even to the color of my coat. The Tree-Crickets
and Toads whistled shrill and loud, until
the jungle was like a great nest of the sweet-feeders&mdash;the
Bees. Then when it was time for rain there
was only more dryness.</p>

<p>"The yellow-clothed Phoongyis (Priests) prayed;
and the Men-kind brought sweetmeats and sheet-gold
to their God Buddha; but still there was
no rain. Miles and miles I traveled for a drink;
and if I made a kill at the pool it was nothing but
skin and bones. The small Deer that bark, what
were they? Not a mouthful. And the Pigs shriveled
up until one might as well have eaten straw.
The Nilgai and the Sambhur-deer, as big as you,
Mooswa, went away from that land of desolation,
and soon nothing seemed to stir in all the jungle but
the Koel Bird; and his cry of 'fee-e-ever!' forever
ringing in my ears drove me full mad.</p>

<p>"Then it was that I stalked close to the place
of the Men-kind&mdash;though I had never killed a
Bullock before&mdash;and I made a kill. But after that
they took the Bullocks under their houses at night,
thinking I would not venture so close.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"But hunger is the death of all fear, and even
there I made a kill. Then again the Men-kind, in
their selfishness, thought to outwit me, for about
the small village they built a stockade."</p>

<p>"Were there no guns?" queried Hathi. "I, who
have been in a big hunt with the Men-kind, have
had them on my back with the fierce-striking guns,
and all that was in the jungle presently fell dead."</p>

<p>Chita laughed disagreeably.</p>

<p>"I almost forgot about that. One day, when
they were still at the stockade making, I saw one of
these Yellow-faced Men tying two sticks together
and sticking them in the ground, somewhat after
the fashion of Mooswa's hind legs. Then surely it
was a gun he put in the crotch of the sticks, pointing
at the little runway I had made for myself.</p>

<p>"I went into the elephant-grass that grew thereabout,
and watching him took thought of this thing.
'It is to do me harm,' I said, 'for is not that my
road? Always now I will come a little to one side,
because of this new thing.'</p>

<p>"And in the evening, as I came to the village,
walking through the same coarse grass, but to one
side, mind you, there saw I two of these Men sitting
behind this thing that was surely a gun.</p>

<p>"Only, because of thee, Sa'-zada, perhaps this
part were better not in the story."</p>

<p>"If it is a true tale it is a true tale," quoth Hathi,
sententiously; "and, as the good Sa'-zada has said,
of things that have happened."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, tell it all," commented the Keeper.</p>

<p>"Only say first you were hungry," sneered
Magh; "hunger covers many sins."</p>

<p>"Yes; I was hungry," moaned Chita; "chee-wough!
so hungry. The Bullock I had killed was
but a collection of bones tied up in a thick skin;
I broke a good tooth trying to get a supper off him.
And were not the Men-kind trying to do evil for
me also, little nut-eater, Magh? They would take
my skin to the Sahib and get much profit in bounty.
I heard them say that as I lay in the thick grass.
I crept close, close&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Behind them," volunteered Wolf, "I know.
You didn't look in their eyes, Brother, did you?"</p>

<p>"They were busy talking," declared Chita, "and
did not look my way. Suddenly I sprang out just
to frighten them, for they were close to the stockade,
and one ran away."</p>

<p>"Only one?" demanded Mooswa, simply.</p>

<p>But Chita had gone over to the corner of his
cage, and sitting down, was swinging his big head
back and forth, back and forth, with his face turned
to the wall, like a Dog that has been whipped.</p>

<p>"He has caught Sa'-zada's eye," whispered
Magh in Hathi's ear.</p>

<p>"It's a nasty tale," said the Keeper, "but I think
it is true."</p>

<p>"Yes; it is true," declared Wild Boar; "that is
the way of his kind."</p>

<p>"Then," said Sa'-zada, "they got this Sahib who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
has written in The Book, and set the snare for Chita
and caught him."</p>

<p>"At any rate, you were caught," muttered
Hathi; "and from what you say, it seems to me a
change for the better."</p>

<p>"Now, Pardus," cried the Keeper, gently tapping
Panther's tail, which hung through between
the bars, "tell us of the manner of your taking."</p>

<p>"I was caught twice," replied Pardus, blinking
his eyes lazily, and yawning until the great
teeth shone white against his black coat; "but you
are right to call me Panther, for I am no Leopard.
And it is so hot here and dry; quite like the place
they took me to&mdash;they of the black faces&mdash;when I
was first caught, being not more than a full-grown
Cub, as was White Leopard. That was at Vizianagram,
up in the hills; but the hills were not like
White Leopard's, all hot and dry. The jungle was
cool and fresh, and full of dark places to hide in,
with deep pools of sweet water that one might
drink after a kill. Here the Birds do nothing but
scream and scold; Hornbill, and Cockatoo, and
Eagle make my head ache with their harsh voices;
there, if a Bird had occasion to speak, it was a
song about the sweet land he lived in. It is well
enough for Hathi to say that being trapped and
brought here is a piece of great luck; for my part,
all day long I do nothing but think, think of the
Madras Hills. There were mango and tamarind,
and peepul, and huge banyan trees, with strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
limbs stretching so far that one could walk out full
over the Deer paths, and wait in sweet content for
a kill. Perhaps even a big family of bamboos
growing up about one's resting-place, and whispering
when the wind blew, and closing up their thick
green leaves to make shade when the sun shone.</p>

<p>"Even where the Men-kind came and sought to
grow raji were plantain trees and palm trees&mdash;Urgh-h-ah!
why should there be anything but
jungle all over the world, it is so beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Don't cry about it, Little Bagheela," sneered
Magh, "for surely there's some sort of a story,
some wondrous lie, in that head of yours."</p>

<p>"True," continued Pardus, as though he had not
caught Magh's observation, "there were disagreeable
things even there. Of course, it will always
be that way when the Bandar-log, the Monkeys, are
about. Silly-headed thieves, they were doing no
manner of good to any one; but more than once,
when I've lain for hours waiting for the chance of
a small kill, and the time of the eating had drawn
near, everything would be upset by the mad laugh
of Lungour, the Bandar-log.</p>

<p>"But I was caught, as Leopard has said, through
the coming together of a lean stomach and a trap of
the Men-kind&mdash;neither a snare, nor the Fire-stick,
but a cage with a door that fell. True, inside was
a Goat, but what mattered that once the door was
down?</p>

<p>"Then they brought me down to the Raja's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
palace in the Plains. Stricken land! that was a
place for any one to choose as a home&mdash;nothing
but red earth, with less growth than there is on the
end of my nose. The Men-kind lived in great
square caves that blared white in the sun. Me-thinks
White Leopard would have felt more at
home there than I did."</p>

<p>"What did those of our kind eat?" queried
Hathi. "Also, where the Men-kind are is the Animal
they call Horse, who is a Grass-eater&mdash;was
there no grass?"</p>

<p>"Scarce any," answered Pardus; "the Black-faced
ones ran here and there with sharp claws,
taking up the poor grass by the root, and all for
the Raja's stables."</p>

<p>"What did they do with you, Bagheela?" asked
Magh, anxious to hear the story, for she was getting
sleepy.</p>

<p>"Put me in a cage in the rose garden, where were
others of my kind&mdash;only they were of the color of
Yellow Leopard. Of course, at first I thought it
was because the Raja was not hungry, and would
eat me another day; but in the next cage was a
Leopard who had been there a long time, and he
told me why we were shut up that way. 'It's for
shikar,' he said. 'Soon all the Sahibs will gather,
and we will be turned loose, and they will kill us
with spears and the firestick.'"</p>

<p>"That's right," commented Sa'-zada, nodding
his head, "I've seen it; also is it written in The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Book. The Raja was a great sportsman, and each
year at Christmas time they had a hunt of this
kind."</p>

<p>"My Mate taught me a trick or two that
helped pass the time," continued Black Panther.
"'Bagheela,' he said to me, 'they will come to us
here on Horses; you who have the end cage may
perchance keep your hand in, and forget not the
manner of a quick clutch with your paw. First,
purr and look sleepy,' he advised; 'second, never
strike when the Horse is beyond reach, for he is
a creature of much fear; third, wait, wait, wait&mdash;have
patience, Little Bagheela. Also, from in
front nothing is done; but stand you ready at the
end of your cage, which is a wall, because there
they cannot see you, and if the Man comes close,
strike quick and sure, for of this manner there is
never but one chance.'</p>

<p>"Now, it happened that a fat Sahib came often
to the cage, and I could see that it was to
teach the Horses not to be afraid of us. It was
hard to mind what my Mate said, for the Sahib
poked me in the ribs with a stick, or tickled
me in the face with his riding-whip; but Yellow
Leopard was always whispering through his
whiskers, 'Wait, wait, wait&mdash;have patience, Little
Bagheela.'"</p>

<p>"This is a long tale," whined Magh, sleepily.</p>

<p>"Keep still, Little One," objected Hathi, "no
great stalk is ever done in a hurry."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"One day," continued Pardus, "I heard the
Horse coming by the end of my cage.</p>

<p>"'Quick! Up!' called my Mate, Yellow
Leopard.</p>

<p>"Like a spring on a Buck I was up on my
hind legs against the end wall, just at the last iron
bar, ready. Around the corner came the Sahib
quite close. It was a new Horse, and he thought
to take pleasure out of frightening the poor Animal
by a sudden sight of us.</p>

<p>"Waugh-houk! With a strong reach I had the
Sahib by the leg.</p>

<p>"Whoo-whoo, waugh-waugh, whoo-o-o-o-waugh!
how he roared. Of course, I did not get him altogether,
for the Horse saved his life by jumping
sideways. I licked the blood that was on my claws,
and Yellow Leopard and I both laughed till the
Keeper came running with a sharp iron bar."</p>

<p>"I warrant you didn't laugh then," chimed in
Magh.</p>

<p>"No; he beat me, though it was all Yellow Leopard's
fault. The fat Sahib swore that he would
have the first spear in when I was let out at the
time of the hunt. He was for having me killed in
the cage; but the Raja said, 'No; his turn will come
in the Shikar'; and when the Raja spoke there was
an end of all argument.</p>

<p>"'Little Bagheela,' said Yellow Leopard to me,
'we will get away to the jungles together at the
hunt time. If they let you out first&mdash;never fear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Little One, you will have a start, for that is the
Raja's way, we are to have a show for our lives,
though I warrant one cannot get very far in five
minutes&mdash;do you run very fast, and when you have
come to the small mud-caves of the Black-kind,
hide in the place where the Bullocks are kept.
They will not look for you there, and not finding
you they will come back, thinking you have gone
to the jungles. When I am let out, I, too, will go
that way, and together nothing will stand between
us and the hills. Should I go first I will wait for
you.'</p>

<p>"Then one day a cage that was on wheels was put
against the door behind which I was kept, and with
bars that were hot they drove me into it. Then
I was taken out to the fields, and when the Sahibs&mdash;there
were many of them&mdash;had gone back on the
road, the door was opened. Would you believe it,
Friends, though I had been eating my heart out
behind the bars yonder, now that I had the chance,
I was almost afraid to venture on the plain. Even
as I crept forth, a yellow-leafed bush suddenly
bent in the wind, and I sprang into the air as
though it were the charge of a Wild Boar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to that, Friends," grunted Soor; "of all
Jungle Dwellers, he has most fear of me."</p>

<p>"But remembering what Yellow Leopard had
said, I ran swiftly toward the little village that
was between me and the hills; but not straight
in the open, mind you&mdash;I had not lived by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
kill in the jungle for nothing. First I leaped
full over a long line of the fierce-pointed aloe
bush&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Phrut! I know that plant," muttered Hathi;
"it has points sharper than the goad of any
Mahout. Sore toes! but I know it well."</p>

<p>"Even so," continued Pardus, "I ran swiftly
along in the shadow of this, and soon found a
Bullock cave such as Yellow Leopard spoke of. In
the end the Men-kind could not find me, for I lay
still, though once I heard the voice of the fat
Sahib quite close, swearing that he longed for a
sight of the 'black brute.' That was not my name,
for I am Pardus the Panther.</p>

<p>"After a little I heard more shouting; then there
was a rustling noise which I knew was the gallop
of Yellow Leopard. He was calling as he ran,
'Ehow-Ehow-Hough, Bagheela!' just as we call
to our Mates in the jungle.</p>

<p>"'A-Houk! here am I,' I cried, rushing out,
thinking that we would soon be safe in the cool
jungle again. And away we dashed. By the loss
of a Kill! we had not gone far till almost in front
of us we saw the fat Sahib and three others on
their Horses full in our path.</p>

<p>"'Oh-ho, my Black Beauty!' he cried, when he
saw me; 'now we'll wipe out the score.'"</p>

<p>"That's like the Men-kind," growled Raj Bagh,
the Tiger; "they cage us and kill us, and if we
so much as raise a claw in defence of our lives we
are reviled, and they have a score against us to
wipe out."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," asserted Pardus, "and long holding in
their hate, too. If we fail in a kill, do we go long
hungered, turning from everything else until we
have slain the one that has escaped us? But there
was the fat Sahib, who had not gone back with
the others, but was still searching to kill me, Black
Panther. Surely that was not what they call shikar
(sport), but a matter of hate he had laid up against
me."</p>

<p>"You should have taken his beatings," declared
Hathi, "even as I have, more times than there are
tusks to your paws; phrut, phrut! it has always
been that way with us Jungle Dwellers. When
the Sahib beat us it is evil fortune if we do not
let it rest at that. True, there was a Mahout once
that went too far&mdash;but what am I saying? surely
I am half asleep. It is your story, Bagheela&mdash;you
were saying that the fat Sahib had killed you&mdash;I
mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pardus, "the fat Sahib&mdash;I stopped;
so did Yellow Leopard, with an angry growl.
Then behind I heard a little trumpet from
Hathi."</p>

<p>"Not me," exclaimed the big Elephant; "I
wasn't there."</p>

<p>"Most surely it is a wondrous lie," declared
Magh; "and now he asks Ganesh to say he was
there and saw it."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no!" interrupted Sa'-zada, "it was another
Elephant."</p>

<p>"Even so," affirmed Pardus; "and on his back
was the Raja, coming in great haste.</p>

<p>"'Charge!' roared Yellow Leopard to me, and
with a rush that was full of wickedness he went
straight for the fat Sahib; and before I knew how
it was done, had broken his neck with the hold
that we all know so well.</p>

<p>"The Raja, without waiting for Hathi to kneel,
jumped from his back, and rushing like the charge
of a Sambhur, drove his spear through Yellow
Leopard as he still held the Sahib by the throat,
and killed him. Well I remember the spear was
buried head deep in the ground.</p>

<p>"In fear, I raced back to the mud-caves in which
were the Bullocks; and they brought the cage again
and put it to the door. But I was afraid to enter
till they dropped fire on me from above. Then I
was taken back to my old quarters, and in the end
sent here to Sa'-zada."</p>

<p>"It's a pity the Sahib was killed," said the
Keeper; "it was a horrible death."</p>

<p>"I was sorry for Yellow Leopard," declared
Pardus, "for he tried to get me away with him to
the jungles."</p>

<p>"Chee-chee! but I am sleepy," yawned Magh,
sliding down Hathi's trunk with the Pup under her
arm. "These tales of killings are enough to make
one have bad dreams."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dreams!" exclaimed Sher Abi, opening his
eyes, for he had been sound asleep; "to be sure, to
be sure! I've had a very bad dream. One should
not eat so much; but after all, I suppose it is the
feathers that are indigestible. E-ugh-h! Sa'-zada,
could you not pluck the chickens before you give
them me to eat? There was a time when I could
digest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, move along, Magar!" interrupted Sa'-zada;
"it is bed-time now. You'll have a chance
to talk some other night."</p>

<p>And presently the Animal town of the Greater
City was quiet, save for the bubble of Camel's long
throat, and the gentle snore of Hathi's pendulous
nose. The moon blinked curiously through the
whispering leaves, and over all there was the solemn
hush that comes in the night when the days
are days of fierce heat.</p>

<h2><a name="SECOND_NIGHT" id="SECOND_NIGHT"></a><big>SECOND NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORY OF HATHI GANESH, THE WHITE-EARED
ELEPHANT</h2>


<p>It was very hot. The Summer moon, pushing
lazily through the whispering tracery of tall
elm trees that cut the night sky, fell upon the same
group of forest friends gathered in front of Tiger's
cage that had been there the previous evening,
when the Leopard brothers had discoursed so
pleasantly of their Jungle life.</p>

<p>"What is the tale to-night, Sa'-zada, loved Master?"
asked Magh, the Ourang-Outang, standing
with one hand on Mooswa's back, who was lying
down.</p>

<p>"It is the talk of Hathi," answered the Keeper.</p>

<p>Hathi could be heard blowing softly through his
trunk to clear his throat, then he began his story:</p>

<p>"We were a mighty herd, all of forty, with two
great Bulls in charge, I remember; though to be
sure when it came to be a matter of danger they
seemed to forget all about being in charge and
cleared off as fast as they could. I soon got to
know that the herd was very proud of me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think they would be, my big beauty,"
cried Magh, patting his forehead affectionately.</p>

<p>"You see," continued Hathi, "these white and
pink spots all over my neck and ears were a sign
that great luck had come to the herd. Even the
Men-kind&mdash;but that, of course, I discovered years
after at Ava&mdash;even the Men-kind looked upon me
as sacred, being a White Elephant. Besides, I
had but the one tusk, the right, and that is why
I am Ganesh, the Holy One.</p>

<p>"We wandered about in the Jungle, and when
we Babe Elephants were tired, the whole herd
waited until we had rested and fed. That's why
the Bulls had nothing to do with leading the herd.
They knew little of what a calf could stand, so
Mah, my Mother, always gave the signal when
we were to start or stop. I think she was very
proud of being the mother of the lucky Calf.</p>

<p>"But it was a lovely land to dwell in; all hills
and valleys with plenty of cover; and down in the
flat lands the Men grew raji and rice, and plantains.</p>

<p>"I think there must be some very wise animal
who arranges all these things&mdash;puts each one in the
Jungle he likes best. Pardus was happy in his
hills, and White Chita liked the snow mountains,
and Yellow Leopard the rice fields; and Mooswa
has told me when we've talked together, that on
the far side of his lands are the loveliest spruce
forests any Moose could wish to live in."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps it was Sa'-zada or one of his kind,"
ventured Muskwa, the Bear.</p>

<p>"It is God who arranges it," declared the
Keeper, in a soft voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know who that may be," muttered
Hathi, "but I thought there was someone. Such a
lovely Jungle it was; tall teak trees and pinkado,
and Telsapa from which the Men-kind drew oil
for their fires.</p>

<p>"For days, and weeks, and months it would be
hot and dry; and then three times the big flower
would come out on the padouk tree, and all the
Elephants would laugh and squeal with their
trunks, for they knew the rain would surely come.
Yes, when we could see for the third time a big
cluster of flowers, patter, patter on the leaves we
could hear the rain, and soon drip, drip, drip,
trickle it would come down on our backs, washing
the dust and little sticks out of every wrinkle until
even the old Bulls would commence to play like
Calves.</p>

<p>"We finally came to a big river early in the
morning, and every one went in for a wash. Mind,
I was only a babe about the size of a Buffalo. The
old ones lay down in the river, just keeping their
trunks out to breathe, and I thought to do the same,
of course; but when I flopped over on my side&mdash;bad
footing! there was nothing anywhere but soft,
slippery water&mdash;there was quite a thousand miles
of it, and dark as the blackest night. I could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
nothing, hear nothing only the angry talk of the
water that ran fast. They said that I screamed
like a young pig. Then something strong grabbed
me by the hind leg, and pulled me out up on the
bank&mdash;it was Mah. She scolded roundly. Then
she spanked me good and hard.</p>

<p>"All that season I was not allowed to go in the
water again. Mah washed me down with her
trunk, squirting the water over me.</p>

<p>"The eating was sweet in those Jungles; but
best of all I liked the young plantains when they
were just beyond the blossom age, all wrapped up
in a big leaf, and juicy, and sweet.</p>

<p>"The first happening was from an evil-minded
Bagh (tiger). That evening I had wandered a
little to one side, not knowing it, and Bagh, with
a fierce word in his big throat, jumped full on my
head. Of course I screamed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a Pig," interjected Boar.</p>

<p>"Like a Babe Hathi," corrected Elephant.
"And Mah, who had been looking for me, just in
the nick of time threw Bagh many yards into the
Jungle with her trunk. I don't know how other
animals get along without a trunk; it seems just
suited for every purpose.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;THEN SOMETHING STRONG GRABBED ME BY THE HIND LEG, AND PULLED
ME&nbsp;...&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"The next happening was worse, for it came
from the Men-kind. It was a hot, hot day. We
were all standing on a hill in the shade of trees,
flapping our ears to keep the flies off, when suddenly
Old Bull kinked his head sideways, whistled
softly through his trunk, and we all stopped flapping
to listen. Even Calf as I was, I knew there
was some danger near. In the wind there was
nothing&mdash;nothing unusual, just the sweet scent of
the tiny little white flowers that grow close to the
short grass. But Old Bull was afraid; he gave a
signal for us to move, and we started.</p>

<p>"In a minute there was an awful cracking like
the breaking of a tree, only different, and we all
ran here, there, everywhere. Of course since that,
having been taken in the hunt by the Men-kind, I
know it was a gun, as they call it.</p>

<p>"Old Bull charged straight for a little white
cloud that rose from where the noise had been;
then crack! crack! crack! the guns trumpeted all
over the Jungle&mdash;but I won't tell any more of that
happening, because Old Bull was killed; and Mah,
too&mdash;though the Men-kind said afterwards, so I've
heard, that it was a mistake, as they only killed
Bulls, being white hunters, for the sake of the feet
and tusks.</p>

<p>"It was late in the evening before the herd gathered
again, and we traveled far, fearing the evil of
the Men-kind."</p>

<p>"Was there no evil with your own people?"
queried Wolf. "Just feeding, and nothing else?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered Hathi, hesitatingly, "sometimes
in a herd there grows up one who is a
'Rogue.' We had one such, I remember. But that
also came about because of the Men-kind&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
yellow man. It was a Hill-man, and when this
Rogue of whom I speak&mdash;he also was a Bull&mdash;was
just full grown, a matter of perhaps twenty
years, this Hill-man thrust into his head, from a
distance, too, being seated in a tree, an arrow.</p>

<p>"The arrow remaining there as it did, caused
this Bull to become of an evil temper. Quarreling,
quarreling always, butting his huge head into a
comrade because of a mere nothing; and with his
tusks putting his mark on many of us without
cause; sometimes it would be a kick from his forefoot,
or a slap of his trunk. When we were near
to the places of the Men-kind he would wallow in
the rice fields, and pull up the young plantain trees
by the roots, even knock the queer little houses
they lived in to pieces, for they were but of bamboo
and leaves. Of course the dwellers ran for their
lives, and sometimes brought fire, and made noise
with their guns, and beat gongs to frighten him
away.</p>

<p>"Many times we drove him forth from the herd;
and sometimes he stayed away himself for days,
sulky. In the end we lost him altogether, and we
were all glad; but strange as it may appear, I saw
him again in Rangoon in the timber yards. That
was after I was caught."</p>

<p>"Tell us about that happening," pleaded Sa'-zada,
"for it is even not written in The Book."</p>

<p>"I was taken in a manner full of deceit, and because
I had faith in those of my own kind. I was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
perhaps, fifteen or twenty years old at the time&mdash;but
in a Hathi's life a year or two is of no moment,
for we are long-lived&mdash;and what might be called
second in charge of the herd, a condition of things
which I resented somewhat, but the Herd Bull had
been leader while I was growing up, so there was
no just claim on my part really.</p>

<p>"And it happened in our wanderings that we
came not far from the greatest of all the Men's
places in that land, Ava (Mandalay). One day
as I was pulling down the young bamboos and stripping
the feathered top, a strange <i>Hathni</i> (female
elephant) came to me and put her trunk softly on
my neck. She was all alone, and I felt sorry for
her; besides, she was nice&mdash;showed me such lovely
places for good feeding. I spent a whole day with
her, and the next day, too, and as we went through
the jungle, suddenly we came to a sort of immense,
strong <i>hauda</i>. It wasn't a bit like the Men's <i>haudas</i>
that they live in, else I should never have been deceived;
great trunks of trees growing up out of
the ground straight, and close together, but no
branches or leaves to them; as square on top as
the end of my leg. This queer-looking jungle thing
troubled me. 'What is it?' I asked Hathni.</p>

<p>"'It's my home,' she replied; 'come in, Comrade.'"</p>

<p>"And of course the woman had her way," remarked
Sa'-zada; "you went into the parlor, Hathi,
old chap, I suppose."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not by that name knew I it, Sa'-zada; they
called it a Keddah, as I found out. But I went in."</p>

<p>"And was caged," laughed Black Chita.</p>

<p>"Inside," continued Hathi, "was a winding path,
and Hathni trotted down this so fast that I lost her.
A great wooden gate dropped behind me, and I
knew that I was in a trap. It was a big place, but
no openings to get out.</p>

<p>"Then the Men-kind showed their yellow faces
all over the walls, just like <i>Hanumen</i>&mdash;the gray-whiskered
Monkey of those parts.</p>

<p>"'A White Elephant at last, at last!' they cried;
'now will the King be pleased.'</p>

<p>"I was left alone that night, but the next day the
Men-kind came with two ruffianly Bulls of my
kind who bunted and bustled me about, and fought
me, while the men slipped great strong ropes over
my legs. In a week I was that tired and sore from
this treatment that I was ready to go any place.
Then I was taken to Ava; and such doings! I
dislike to tell it all; it's hardly modest.</p>

<p>"They put a silk covering over me to keep the
Flies off, and a garland of white jasmine flowers
about my neck&mdash;sweet-smelling flowers they were;
in my ears two big red stones of the ruby kind were
placed; and always as I walked a great silk umbrella
was over my head. And as for eating&mdash;humpf,
humpf, humpf! they just made me ill with
sweets to be eaten out of gold dishes."</p>

MY LEGS.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Is this a true tale, O Sa'-zada?" queried Black
Leopard. "For one of the jungle folk it is a
strange happening."</p>

<p>"It is true," replied the Keeper; "that was the
way with the White Elephant at the Burma King's
court, it is written in another book I have read."</p>

<p>"And no one was allowed to ride on my back
but the King," declared Hathi, "excepting, of
course, the Mahout. As I walked I was afraid
of stepping on some one; the Men-kind were forever
flopping down on their knees to worship me.
It was this way for years; then one season there
came war; great guns spoke with a roar louder
than Bagh's; and vast herds of the white-faced
Men-kind came, letting free the blood of the yellow-faced
ones; and in the end I was taken away,
and sent down to Rangoon, and put to work in
the timber yards. There was no worship, and
few sweetmeats, and for silk covering I was given
a harness with leather collar and chain traces. It
was like being back in the jungle again&mdash;I was just
a common Hathi, only I was called there Raj
Singh.</p>

<p>"It was at that time I met the Bull who was a
Rogue. He was also working in the timber yards,
but it had done him much good&mdash;his temper was
improved."</p>

<p>"Was it kind treatment cured him?" asked Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"No," replied Hathi; "they whipped him into a
gentle behavior. Two big Bulls with heavy iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a><br /><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
chains swinging from their trunks thrashed him
until he promised to cease making trouble. But
one day he broke out bad, and smashed everything&mdash;tore
the Master's dogcart to pieces, knocked the
Cooly's <i>haudas</i> down, and trumpeted like an evil
jungle spirit. He even killed his Mahout, which
was a silly thing, though he declared his driver, the
Mahout, sitting up on his back, one foot on either
side, had prodded viciously at his head until poor
Rogue's blood was on fire.</p>

<p>"But in the end they sent me away to Sa'-zada,
and I am quite content"; and reaching his big trunk
over to the Keeper, Hathi caressed the latter's
cheek lovingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, we are all content," declared Magh; "for
Sa'-zada is a kind and gentle Master."</p>

<p>"Now, all to your cages and your pens," cried
the Keeper, "for it is late. To-morrow night, perhaps,
we shall have the tale of Gidar, the Jackal."</p>

<h2><a name="THIRD_NIGHT" id="THIRD_NIGHT"></a><big>THIRD NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORIES OF GIDAR, THE JACKAL,<br />
AND COYOTE, THE PRAIRIE WOLF</h2>


<p>"To-night," commenced Sa'-zada, "we
are to have the interesting life story of
the two half-brothers, Gidar and Coyote."</p>

<p>"A thief's tale of a certainty," chuckled Magh.</p>

<p>"In my land, which was Burma, there were none
so useful as we," began Gidar. "Not of high repute
our mission, perhaps, but still useful, being
scavengers; and to this end we are all born with a
fair appetite; but useful always, even Bagh knows
that. I was Lieutenant to one of his kind&mdash;a great
killer he was&mdash;for a matter of two years. Then
he came by way of a dispute with the Men-kind,
and they finished him in short order.</p>

<p>"Now, you know, Brothers, our kind have steadily
worked southward from India, pushing into new
lands from all time, even like the Sahibs, until we
are now half down through Burma. It must be a
dull land that has not our sweet song at night. If
there were but a Pack here now we'd sing you a
rare chorus."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've heard the song," quoth Bagh; "it's
wretched."</p>

<p>"How goes it?" asked Wolf. "Our Pack has
a cry of great strength; the 'bells of the forest,'
the Redmen call it."</p>

<p>"It's somewhat this way," said Jackal, and sitting
on his haunches he raised his long, sharp
nozzle high in air, stretching his lean throat toward
the moon that glinted fretfully through the swaying
trees; and on the still, quiet night air floated
his cry of far-off India:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'<i>Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-o-o-o-o-o!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I smell a dead Hindoo-oo!</i>'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That would be my cry, Brothers. Then from
all quarters of the jungle the Pack would take up
the song and sing back:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'<i>Where, where, where, where, where, where?</i>'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"And I would answer back cheerily:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'<i>Here, here, here, here, here, here!</i>'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Then all together we would sing with all our
lungs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'<i>Oo-oo-oo-o-o-o-o-h</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mussulman or Hind-oo?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Here, there, or anywhere,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All flesh is flesh, we do not care.</i>'"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"A charming song," sneered Magh.</p>

<p>"Ah, I cannot give it right; you should have
heard it, little Eater-of-sour-fruit, in the dead closeness
of a Burman jungle, from the many throats
of a hungry Pack.</p>

<p>"The people of that land liked the song full well,
and they never molested us. But life was one continuous
struggle for food. We were not slayers
like Chita, or Bagh, or Python; or stealers of crops
like Boar and Rogue Hathi; almost as simple in
our way of life as Mooswa.</p>

<p>"I remember once a fat Dog-pup of the Terrier
kind, which I bagged. It was all the fault of the
Pup's master; he tried to kill me."</p>

<p>"You had probably been singing to him," said
Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"We had, I admit," answered Jackal. "It was
on Borongo Island; two men, Sahibs they were
called there, you know, lived in a bungalow built
on high posts, after the manner of all houses in that
land. The bungalow was built on the shore, and
every day the water came up under it, and then
went back again. This was a most wise arrangement
of the water's traveling, for it threw up
many a dead Fish and Crab for our eating.</p>

<p>"Well I remember the cook-house was a little
to one side from the bungalow, with a poor, ill-conditioned
bamboo door to it. Regularly, doing
our scavenger work, we used to clean up that cook-house,
eating everything the servant-kind had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
devoured. Several times I made a great find in
that very place, for the cook, it appears, was a most
forgetful fellow. When there was nothing left for
us in the way of food, we'd carry off the pots and
pans into the jungle grass; why, I hardly know, but
it seemed proper to do so.</p>

<p>"Neither do I know which of the Pack first
started singing under the bungalow; but this also
afforded us much content. Many hours on in the
dark we'd all steal gently down from the jungle,
and gather under the house. Then, as one, we'd
give voice to the hunger cry together, until even
the Sahibs would shout in fear. It was good to
make the Men-kind afraid; but also we would flee
swiftly, for the two Sahibs would rush out like
a jackal that had suddenly become possessed of
much poisoned meat, and 'bang, bang, bang' with
the guns.</p>

<p>"I had much to do with Men, and just when I
thought they were full cross because of our serenade,
what was my surprise to find each evening a
full measure of rice put in a certain place for me.
'It is full of the datura' (poison), I thought, and
watched while a lean Pariah Dog from the village
ate it. But there was nothing wrong with it. So
the next evening I made haste to get a full share of
it myself. As I ate, hurriedly I must say, twang-g!
came a mighty Boar-spear.</p>

<p>"But only the shaft of it struck my back, so I
made off with great diligence. I heard the Sahib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
say as he picked up the spear, 'Missed him, by
Jove!' You see, he had been hiding in a corner of
the bungalow. But I was hungry, and the rice was
good&mdash;most delicious&mdash;so I crept back with two
comrades, and keeping to the thick grass, stalked
the bungalow most carefully. I saw the Sahibs all
at their eating, for the door was open, it being
hot; you see, he thought I wouldn't come back so
soon.</p>

<p>"'I will eat with you,' I said, and made straight
for the rice; but it was nearly all gone; the Terrier
Pup of which I have spoken, and which belonged
to this very Sahib who had thrown the spear, was
just finishing his Master's bait.</p>

<p>"'Oh, you wicked Dog!' I said, 'to steal my supper
this way,' and knowing that his master was in
the habit of throwing spears at that very spot, I
picked him up and carried him to the jungle for
safety.</p>

<p>"'Oh, oh E-u-u-h!' how he squealed, and the
Men-kind left their eating, and came rushing after
us with much shouting, but it was dark and they
had no chance of catching us."</p>

<p>"And you ate the poor little fellow?" asked
Mooswa.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" cried Magh, "to eat a Dog."</p>

<p>"Not at all bad stuffed with rice, I assure you,"
declared Gidar. "For a day or two I kept more or
less out of the way; I was afraid the Sahibs might
be very angry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was two nights after this I discovered more
rice some distance from the bungalow in a pail
which was sunk in the ground, and over this stood
a couple of posts that had not been there before.
I remembered that, so I sat by quietly watching
this new thing, and trying to decide what it might
be.</p>

<p>"Now the Sahibs had two pigs, and as I watched,
along came these two, grunting, and shoving things
about with their long noses, and presently one of
them discovered the rice in the pail.</p>

<p>"'Ugh, ugh, ugh!' said he, 'just a mouthful of
this will do me good.' You know, of course, a pig
eats first and thinks after, so in this case he plunged
his big head in the pail, and 'zip! whang!' went
something, and before I could jump to my feet he
was dangling in the air hung by the neck; he didn't
even have a chance to squeal. Of course his mate
took to his heels and cleared out, while I finished
the rice, knowing the evil was in the custody of
my Squeaker friend. In the morning the Pig was
dead."</p>

<p>"It's a fine thief's tale," commented Magh, "but
in the end they caught you right enough."</p>

<p>"Not there," corrected Gidar; "that was another
place. A Sahib who had come to the jungle
seeking dwellers for such places as this, made the
taking; but with him one might as well be caught
first as last, for he knew more of our ways than we
knew of his. Now let Coyote speak; I am tired."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does Coyote come from Burma, too, O Sa'-zada?"
queried Magh.</p>

<p>"No, he's from Mooswa's country; from the
great plains away in the far West. There is not
much in The Book about Coyote; that is, not much
that's good."</p>

<p>"I knew it," laughed Magh; "I've watched him
there in his cage which is opposite mine, day after
day, and I never saw a smile on his face."</p>

<p>"You should be put in the cage with Hyena,"
declared Coyote, "if you think an animal has got to
grin all the time to be of fair nature. Or of what
use are you, little pot-belly, or the whole of your
tribe&mdash;Hanuman, Hooluk, or Chimpanzee&mdash;none
of you worth the nuts you eat; and yet you're always
grinning and chattering, and playing fool
tricks about the cage. You're a fine one to judge
your fellow creatures."</p>

<p>"Coyote just sits there and scratches Fleas, and
growls, and snaps at his mate&mdash;he's a low-born sort
of Wolf," continued Magh.</p>

<p>"He's not of our kind," declared Wolf; "it's all
a lie."</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind," cried Sa'-zada, "no
doubt like all the rest of us he has his good and
bad qualities."</p>

<p>"I was once starving," resumed Coyote. "You
who have lived in a warm land where something is
growing all the year round, know nothing of the
hunger that comes when the fierce blizzard blots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
out everything, and there is only snow, snow, everywhere.
Can one eat snow? It's all very fine for
you with a paunch full of candy to sit there and
prate about stealing, but if Wie-sak-ke-chack puts
the hunger pains in one's stomach and the fat
bacon&mdash;Ghurr-h-h! but the juice of it is sweet when
one is near dead&mdash;puts the fat bacon behind log
walls, what is one to do, eh? Does a fellow dig,
dig, dig through earth so hard that he must bite it
out with his teeth, dig deep under the log walls for
sport as the Cubs play in the sunshine, or just to
steal? Bah, you who have never known hunger
know not of this thing. Why, once when the
ground was frozen hard, and I was dying inch by
inch, some fierce-toothed Animal inside me biting,
biting&mdash;only of course it was the hunger chewing
at my stomach&mdash;I dove fair through the window
of a log shack to get at the meat inside. The glass
cut me, to be sure, but that was nothing to the
hunger pain that goes on, on, never ceasing until
there is food, or one is dead.</p>

<p>"I saved a man's life once at a post called Stand-Off.
The place came by its name in the days of a
mighty fight when my Man and his comrades stood
off the Mounted Police. These Men had been
given as bad a name as Coyotes even. My Man
may have been bad, too; but how was I to know,
being only a Coyote? He was always throwing me
bones and pieces of bread, and whistling to me, and
calling me Jack.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now this place Stand-Off was on the river flat,
and one night in spring-time I heard a great flood
coming down the Belly River. It was a still night,
and the noise of the rushing water came to my
ears for miles, but the Men heard it not, for they
were all in the Shacks. Fast I galloped down over
the flat near to the Shack where was this Man who
had often thrown me a bone. I whimpered, and
whistled, and barked the danger call, and howled
the death-coming song, and finally my friend came
to the door and threw a stick of wood at me, and
spoke fierce oaths. Then he shut the door. I
could hear the roaring getting louder and louder,
and knew that soon it would be too late for all the
Men-kind; not that I cared, except for this one.
On one side of the town was the swift-running
Belly River, and beyond a high-cut bank; on my
side was the flat land that would soon be many feet
deep with ice and rushing water. So I howled
louder than ever, and he came out and strove to
kill me with a Firestick, but I only ran a little piece
into the darkness, and howled again.</p>

<p>"Being a Man of much temper he chased me,
and the noise brought out the others, for they
thought it was Indians. I sought to lead him over
to the side of the flat land which was next the
sloping hill, knowing full well that the new water
would flow there first.</p>

<p>"All at once he ceased running behind me, and
I, who was listening, knew that he scarce breathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
he was that still. Now, he will hear it, I thought;
and in an instant I heard him cry to the others:
'Boys, we must pull out from this&mdash;there's a devil
of a freshet coming.' That was the way of the
Men from Stand-Off; many strange words of a
useless need.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Comrades, it was soon an awful night;
here and there the Men ran trying to save something&mdash;their
Horses and guns for most part, even
some of the evil firewater; and the strong swearings
they used sounded but just as the whimpering
of Wolf Pups, the wind was that fierce, carrying
the dreadful roar of the Chinook flood.</p>

<p>"You who have heard Bagh and Hathi scolding
at each other, with perhaps Black Panther and
Bald Eagle taking part, may know somewhat the
like of that night's noises.</p>

<p>"Seeing that my Man was coming riding swiftly
on his Cayuse, I, too, ran quickly for the upland;
but, as I have said, just in the hollow which was
there, being the trail where once had run the river,
the flood was rushing even as I have seen it in the
foot-hills&mdash;the flat land was surrounded.</p>

<p>"As the Men galloped up they stopped, and
spoke evil words at the flood, rushing up and down
looking for a ford. I also was afraid to cross.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I thought me of a place I knew well
lower down, wondrous like a Beaver dam, though
I think there had been no Beavers in the land since
Chief Mountain was a hole in the ground. I
barked, to call my Man friend, and ran toward
this spot.</p>

<p>"'There goes that locoed Coyote,' I heard him
say; 'he's trailing for a crossing; damned if I don't
follow him. Come on, you fellows,' and after me
they galloped like madmen.</p>

<p>"Just below the place that was like a dam the
water was not too bad, for the ice had jammed up
above, and it was spreading out all over the flat.
I plunged in, for, Comrades, it was a time of great
hurry. Swimming a river is not of my liking&mdash;none
of my kind like it&mdash;but this seemed an evil
night altogether, with no choice but to reach the
uplands.</p>

<p>"'Sure thing! the Coyote's dead to rights on this
outfit,' I heard my Man say; and wallow, wallow,
in the bronchos came, splashing and snorting. And
so we crossed just as the ice broke in the jam, and
swept down like the swift rolling of many stones.
I heard my Man say as they all got down from the
horses to empty the water out of their long boots,
'If I ever clap peeps on to that Coyo again,
I'll shove grub pile into him till he busts. Strike
me dead if he hasn't saved the whole outfit of
us.'</p>

<p>"Anyway I knew there would be much feeding
and no harm if I kept close to these evil Men-kind,
for they were great givers.</p>

<p>"I sought to save the one man, and if there be
any credit it comes to me because of that; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
others followed him, and even they said <i>he</i> had
saved them."</p>

<p>"I think it is a true tale," declared Mooswa, "for
I once had a happening in saving the life of a Boy
who had been good to me."</p>

<p>"What happened to the Men's place, Dog-Wolf?"
queried Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"In the morning there was nothing&mdash;nothing but
great pieces of ice all over the flat. Then the Men
trailed for a place called Slideout, where were more
evil men of the firewater way of life, and I followed,
arranging it so that my Man saw me, and
that day when he killed an Antelope, he left a
sweet piece of the eating for me; and I might have
lived all my life close to their camp in great fatness,
but for the evil chance that drew the Men-kind
close to a place called MacLeod. And it was there,
being pursued by ferocious yellow-haired Dogs, I
hid in a Hen-house and was caught. At first they
were for killing me, but there happened a Man-Pup
of that house who cried for me as his Doggie, and
later came one of the Men-kind, gave blankets in
exchange for me, and I was sent here to the place
where is Sa'-zada."</p>

<p>"He is either a great liar, or not so bad as is
written in The Book," commented Sher Abi, the
Crocodile; "but in my land where was his Brother,
the Jackal, I never heard good of his kind."</p>

<p>"I am sure it is a true tale," declared Sa'-zada;
"Coyote could not have made it up."</p>

<h2><a name="FOURTH_NIGHT" id="FOURTH_NIGHT"></a><big>FOURTH NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORY OF RAJ BAGH, THE KING TIGER</h2>


<p>While the Keeper Sa'-zada was still loitering
over his tea, there came to his ears an
imperious roaring call "Wah-h-h! Wah-h-h! Wah-houh!"</p>

<p>"This is the Tiger's night, indeed," he muttered
to himself. "Old Raj Bagh is eager to tell us the
tale of his life." Then he hurried down to their
cages and corrals saying, "Come, comrades; the
King of the Jungle calls us."</p>

<p>"We shall have strong tales of blood-letting to-night,"
muttered Magh the Orang-Outang.</p>

<p>"King of the Jungle, indeed!" sneered
Hathi, the Elephant. "When I was Lord of
the jungle I knew no king&mdash;that is, amongst the
animals."</p>

<p>"Now," began Sa'-zada, opening The Book,
when the Jungle Dwellers had all gathered in front
of Bagh, the killer's cage; "now we shall know all
about Huzoor Stripes. And mind you, Hathi, and
all the rest, there must be no anger, for Bagh's way
of life has not been of his own making; for with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
his kind it is their nature to kill that which they
eat."</p>

<p>"I was born in Chittagong," began Bagh, "and
well I remember the little <i>Nullah</i> in which my
Mother kept me, a big tea garden spread over
three hills just near our hiding place, and there was
always much good eating.</p>

<p>"For months after I was born my Mother made
me hide in the <i>Nullah</i>. That was always in the
evening. And as for hiding, how anyone can get
along without stripes in his coat I can't understand.
Let me hide in a grass field where the sun throws
sharp shadows up and down across everything and
I'll give my ration of meat for the week to anyone
who can see me three lengths of my tail away."</p>

<p>"Where was your Mother all this time?" queried
Magh, tauntingly.</p>

<p>"To be sure," answered Bagh, "she would be
away for hours making the kill, and when she came
back would lick my face, and teach me the sweet
smell of new meat and hot blood. Then the next
evening, just as it was getting dark, she would take
me with her to the kill, which was usually a Cow,
and which she had very cunningly hidden in elephant
grass, or a bamboo clump, or some little
<i>Nullah</i>. There would be still half of it left. I
grew big and strong, and longed to make a kill on
my own account.</p>

<p>"But that year a terrible thing happened to the
Buffaloes and Cows upon which we depended for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
food. They were all down in the Flat Lands,
which is close by the sea, and one day when the
jungle was much torn by strong, fierce winds, a
great water came over the land, and ate up all the
Cattle, and many of the Men-kind. Then, indeed,
we fairly starved, for the few that were left were
kept close to the bamboo houses of the villagers.
Night after night, even in the day-time, my Mother
and I sought for the chances of a kill, for I had
grown big at that time, and she took me with her.
We were really starving; perhaps a small Chital
(deer), or a Dog, or something came our way once
in a while, but the pain in my stomach was so great
that I moaned, and moaned, and I believe it was
because of me that my Mother became a Man-killer."</p>

<p>"Horrible!" exclaimed Mooswa. "Became a
killer of the Men-kind? Dreadful!"</p>

<p>"I, too, have killed Men," asserted Raj Bagh;
"and why is it so evil, my big-nosed eater-of-grass?
Your food is the leaves of the jungle, and you have
it with you always. When you are hungry you
walk, walk, and soon you come to where there is
much food, and you eat, and with you that is all
right&mdash;there is no evil in it. As Sa'-zada has said,
it is our way of life to kill our eating. When there
is no Chital we kill Sambhur; when there are no
Deer we kill Pigs, or even Buffalo; when there is
nothing but Man, and we are changed from our
usual way of kill by great hunger, we slay Man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
With all Dwellers of the Jungle, there is fear of
the Men-kind, that is all, nothing but fear; and
when once that is broken we kill the Men-kind
even as any other Jungle Dweller."</p>

<p>"Little Brother," began Sa'-zada, "it is spoken
amongst my Kind, that a Man-killer is always an
old, broken-toothed Tiger, full-manged, and of
evil ways; and that once having tasted human flesh
he becomes a killer of nothing else."</p>

<p>"Ha-hauk!" laughed Bagh, "those be silly
Jungle tales. Am I broken-toothed, or full of a
mange, or is Raj Bagh? All a lie, Little Master,
all a lie. It is but a chance of the Jungle that
makes a Man-killer, even as I will tell, and the
taste of the flesh is not more than the taste of meat.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, "I was with my Mother
that day, the first day of the Man-kill, and in my
stomach was a great pain like the biting of Red
Ants. It was near the coming of night, and we
crept down into the tea garden where there were
many of the coolie kind working amongst the
bushes. I think my Mother was looking for a stray
dog, or perhaps a small Bullock; but the coolies
seeing us cried aloud in their fright, 'Bagh hai!'
and ran. I think it was this that made my Mother
charge suddenly amongst them, for if they had
stood and looked at us I'm sure we should have
turned and gone away; but in the charge a Man
fell. Baghni seized him by the neck, threw him
on her back, and we both galloped into the jungle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
After that, whenever we were hungry we went back
to the tea garden in just the same way.</p>

<p>"But one day a coolie saw us first and ran to his
master's bungalow crying with much fear. Neither
of us thought anything of that, for it was as they
had done before; so we went on down in the little
<i>Nullah</i> between the hills, looking sharply for others
of the Black Workers. Suddenly I heard a noise
as of something approaching.</p>

<p>"'Keep still, O Baghela,' said Baghni, 'here
cometh one of the Men-kind, and I will make a
kill.'</p>

<p>"As we waited, presently there was no sound.
'The kill has gone away,' I whispered to Baghni,
but she struck me hard with her tail, almost knocking
some of my teeth out; that was to keep still.
There was not even any scent of the Men-kind in
the wind now; most surely he had gone away, I
thought. What a silly old Baghni my Mother
must be.</p>

<p>"I heard a soft whistle behind me, 'Sp-e-e-t!'
just like that, much as you've heard Hawk in his
cage call. When I looked around there was one of
the White-face, even the Sahib of the tea garden.
I knew him, for I had seen him once before. In
his hand he held what I have since learned was a
thunder-stick. I looked in his eyes for perhaps
three lashes of my tail, but I could see there nothing
of the Man-fear Hathi has told us of. Such eyes I
have never seen in any animal's head; not yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
like those of my kind, nor red and black like
Hathi's, nor even dull brown like Korite the killer's;
just of a quiet color like a tiny bit of the sky
coming between the leaves of the forest.</p>

<p>"What was he waiting for, I thought. Baghni
had not heard him, for she did not turn her head.
Then he made the call like Hawk's again, and
Baghni turned her head even as I had, and looked
full at him, but he did not run away.</p>

<p>"Now feeling something lifted from me, because
his eyes were on Baghni, I think, I looked again
sideways from the corner of my eye. Baghni had
set her ears tight back, and drawn her lip up in a
cross snarl, so that her teeth, almost the length of
Boar's tusks, said as plain as could be, 'Now I will
crush your back.' But still in his eyes that were
like bits of sky was not the Man-fear; if I had seen
it there most surely I had charged straight at his
throat, for I was angry, and still, I think, filled with
much fear.</p>

<p>"Then Baghni turned around, crouched with her
head low, looking straight at him. As she did so,
the Sahib raised his thunder-stick, there was an
awful noise from it, I heard Baghni scream 'Gur-houk!'
and she had charged. I, too, followed her,
thinking she had got this Man who was our kill;
but just beyond in the <i>Nullah</i>, even the length of
Bainsa's corral from here, I saw her on her side
tearing up the tea bushes with her great paws. I
stopped for the length of two breaths, but I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
see that there was something very wrong&mdash;she was
going to sleep. Then the greatest fear that I have
ever known came over me, and I galloped fast into
the jungle to where was my hiding-place."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="i_070" id="i_070"></a>
<img src="images/i_070.jpg" width="600" height="412" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">&quot;BUT I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY WRONG ...&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"They had killed your Mother, had they,
Bagh?" asked Mooswa.</p>

<p>"I think so, for I never saw her again. I was
afraid to go back where the men labored, and, as
I had said, there were no Bullocks, and I nearly
starved to death."</p>

<p>"But how did they catch you?" queried Magh.</p>

<p>"It was all because of my hunger. When I was
not stronger than a jungle Bakri (sheep), not
having eaten for days and days, I heard one night
a Pariah Dog howling in the jungle. It took me
hours to know that there was no danger near this
crying one of the Dog-kind. I went round and
round in circles that I had made smaller each time,
and drew the wind from all sides into my nose to
see if there was the Man scent. There was nothing
but the Pariah, and by some means he had got
into a hole. Of course, afterwards I knew it was
the evil work of this Sahib who had killed Baghni.
Such a hole the Pariah was in, it was as long as
these two cages, and though wide at the bottom,
it was small at the top, even like the cover of
Magh's house yonder. I crawled in and caught
the Dog in my strong jaws. Sweet flesh! how he
howled when he knew I was coming.</p>

<p>"Then with a crash something fell behind me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and closed the hole so I could not get out, and at
once I heard them shouting."</p>

<p>"Where had they come from so soon?" queried
Magh.</p>

<p>"They were up in the jungle trees," answered
Bagh.</p>

<p>"I think it is a fine lie," grunted Boar. "Do you
mean to say, Bagh, that you could not see them
in the trees?"</p>

<p>"You have little knowledge of my kind, Piggy.
Know you not that when going through the jungle
we never look up?"</p>

<p>"I do," interrupted Raj Bagh, "but I learned the
trick. Brother Bagh is right, though; I suppose
it comes from always looking for our kill on the
ground, and I have heard that this is why the
Hunters so often kill us from <i>Machans</i> (shooting
rest in a tree). We never see them until we are
struck."</p>

<p>"The Men were all about the hole," continued
Bagh, "and it was he of the white face that cried,
'Don't kill him, don't stick him with the spears!
He is only a Baghela, and we will take him alive
for Sa'-zada.'</p>

<p>"They dug little holes from the top, and bound
me with strong ropes; it was so narrow I couldn't
turn round, you see. Then I was sent here to
Sa'-zada. Though he is good to me, still I wish
I was back in my old jungle."</p>

<p>"Ah-h-houk! Great Brothers," roared Raj<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Bagh. "My mate has told you of Chittagong and
his tea gardens, but the middle jungles in India is
the place for a Tiger to rule; and for years I was
Lord of the Sumna Forests, and the terror of the
Gonds, the little black-faced Men who are wondrous
Shikaris. Close grass. Waw-hough! but it
was beautiful there. The many red faces of the
chewal tree smiled at me, and the purple ears of
the sal tree listened to my roar till its great branches
trembled in fear. Close hid in the Khagar grass
I would lie and sleep all through the long hot day,
and the little Gonds, even the big, white-faced
Men, might pass the length of this cage from me,
and not know that I was there. But I would know.
Talking, talking always they would go, and if they
were up wind, my nose would find them many
jumps away.</p>

<p>"I was born there, and Baghni, my Mother, and
Sher Bagh, my Sire, taught me all that a Tiger
should know of the ways of the Men-kind. But in
the end both of them came to their death through
the evil ways of these seekers for our lives. Wah,
wah, wah-hough! I am a Man-killer. And why
not?"</p>

<p>"You should be ashamed to say so," cried Magh,
petulantly, "and before Sa'-zada, too."</p>

<p>"Wah! I was a Man-killer," repeated Raj
Bagh, "a killer of many Men, but it was not my
fault. When I was a cub my Sire was Lord of the
Sumna Jungles; and close to our lair was a <i>jhil</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
which all animals of those parts came to drink when
they were hot, and the hills blazed red with the
evil fire of the little Gonds. Chetal, and Nilgai,
and Sambhur, and the Ribbed-Faced Deer that
coughed like a Wild Dog; even Chinkara, the little
Gazelle that is but a mouthful for one of my needs&mdash;all
came there when the forest grew dark; and
always when we were hungry, which was often,
more came than went away. It was ever the same
with Sher Bagh, who was my Sire, and Baghni, always
the same way in a kill with them. In those
days I watched it often, for I, being a Bagheela,
took no part except in the eating. Chita walks not
softer in his cage than Sher Bagh would step
through the jungle when he was stalking a kill;
and then at the end with a rush it was all over.</p>

<p>"But one year it became so hot&mdash;why, the rocks
burned our pads as we walked; so hot that our <i>jhil</i>
dried up, and none of the Jungle Dwellers came to
drink. It was hot, so hot, and never a drop of the
sweet water falling. The fire crept down from
the hills and ate up the small part of the jungle
and the grass, and I think the Jungle Dwellers went
to other parts. At any rate, as Brother Bagh has
said, we were sore distressed for a kill. Of course,
we could go and drink where the other Dwellers
dared not, close to the villages of the little Gonds.
I remember, being but a Baghela and having little
wisdom, saying to Baghni, 'Why do we not kill
Goru (cattle) and Bainsa, who are here in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
hands of the Men-kind?' But Sher Bagh, who had
lived into much wisdom, growled, and striking me
hard with his paw, said, 'Little one, that way comes
the full hate of the Men-kind, and we who fear not
the Dwellers in the Jungle, fear Man.'</p>

<p>"But still we became more hungry, and Baghni,
whose milk was my only food, grew unwise and
said, 'Let us kill the Goru.' But Sher Bagh
growled at her, and said again, 'That way comes
the hate of the Men-kind. Now when these little
men who are Gonds pass near to me in the jungle,
they salaam and say, "Peace be with you, Sher
Bagh, Huzoor Bagh"; and they go in peace, and
the fear that is on me when I look in their eyes
passes away.'</p>

<p>"For many nights after that we wandered far
through the jungle, I with Baghni, and Sher Bagh
by himself in another part. And in the days that
were so hot, as I slept, great times of blood drinking
and sweet meat-eating came to my mind&mdash;but
when I woke there was nothing&mdash;nothing but
hunger pains in my stomach. It was also this way
with Baghni and Sher Bagh. Many times Baghni
said, 'Let us kill the Goru, for of what use is the
good will of the Men-kind if we die?'</p>

<p>"At last Sher Bagh also became unwise, and
said, 'We will kill the Goru, for Baghela and you,
Baghni, are starving. When the Goru feed in a
herd to-morrow, even in the time of light&mdash;which,
of course, was the day&mdash;together we will creep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
close in the much-thorned korinda, and kill a Cow;
for if we kill one in a herd there will be less trouble,
and perhaps it will not be missed of the Men-kind.'
Wah! I shall never forget the sweet eating of that
Goru. And the drink of blood! Che-hough! it
was as though I had been athirst since my birth.</p>

<p>"Sher Bagh dragged the Goru to a jungle of
Kakra trees, and we ate it all. But the next day
the Horned Ones did not feed in that place, and as
we were walking in the close of the daytime Sher
Bagh heard the thin-voiced cry of a Gond cart
coming over the road; it was like the song of the
Koel bird; it was made by the wheels, I think.
'There will be Goru to the cart,' said Sher Bagh.
'Yes, two of them,' answered Baghni, 'but also one
of the Men-kind, a little Gond.' 'Even now I am
hungry,' declared Sher Bagh; 'when I roar in front
of the Goru the little Gond will pass quickly into a
sal tree, and then we can eat of his Bullocks.'</p>

<p>"It was as my Sire had said, and we made a kill,
and carried them far from the roadside, and had
the sweetest eating for two nights. All our
strength was coming back to us, and Baghni, purring
softly, for she was pleased, said to her Lord,
'Did I not say "drink the blood of the Goru," when
we were starving, and are they not easy of kill?'
But Sher Bagh, looking up in the trees, for it was
as we came to the kill for our second night's eating,
answered, 'We must be careful, for upon us will
surely fall the full hate of these little Gonds; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
they claim a kill for a kill, blood for blood; it is
their manner of life when they deal with others of
the Men-kind.'</p>

<p>"I knew that fear of the little Gonds had come
strong upon my Sire when he looked up to the sal
trees, for, as I have said, it is not of our habit to
look up; we fear nothing of the jungle that hides
in trees. The Peacocks, and Monkeys, and Crows,
even Panther&mdash;what are they? Nothing to claim
the time of my kind. Said Sher Bagh to Baghni,
'The Goru that go in carts are easy for the kill.'
'And there are always two of them,' answered she.</p>

<p>"This new manner of life by practice became
easy to us; we would hide in the khagar grass or
the jowri, which is a nut grass of the Men, beside
the road at the day's end, and always we would
know of the cart's coming by its voice, that was like
Koel bird's, or the miaou of a Peacock. We made
many a kill of this kind. And it was this way that
I became first of all a Man-killer, even my first
kill was of the Men-kind, just an evil chance. It
was Baghni who said to Sher Bagh, 'Baghela must
know the method of a kill. We have now not
much hunger, so let him make the next kill of the
Goru, and if he misses, it will not matter, for we
are well fed.'</p>

<p>"I shall never forget that night as I crouched
by the road beside Baghni, waiting for the little
Gond with his Goru. I was trembling like the tall
grass shivers at the top when one passes through it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
'Keep still,' whispered Baghni; 'a little noise makes
a hard kill, and much noise is no kill at all.' If
it had been a Sambhur or a Nilgai we should have
had no supper, for the grass whispered under me
as I shook it with my trembling. Then down the
road in the early dark came the cart with its snarling
voice. Just as the Goru were opposite, Baghni
struck me with her tail and cried, 'Ah-h-houk!'
which means to charge. As I sprang, being but a
Baghela, and my first kill, I was slow, and the Goru
jumped, causing me to miss sadly. But I landed
full on the cart, and by an evil chance the little
Gond was under my paws. Mind, Comrades, with
me it was but a kill, and I could not see his eyes,
and without intent on my part his shoulder was in
my jaws, and in less time than I can tell it I had him
in the jungle. It was my first kill, and I was wild&mdash;but
I don't want to talk about it. I wish he had
beaten me off, even struck me with the thunder-stick,
for, after all, what was the kill? not bigger
than a Chetal, and it brought the full hate of the
Men-kind to us, and Sher Bagh and Baghni were
slain."</p>

<p>"By the little Gonds?" asked Hathi.</p>

<p>"The Gonds and the Sahibs," answered Tiger.
"Even your people, Hathi, took part in the kill of
my Sire and Baghni. But it was our old enemy,
hunger, that caused it all. For three nights we
waited by the roadside and no carts passed. It is
true one passed; a lodhi cartman, with the wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of Cobra, put Pig's fat on the wheels of his cart,
and there was no noise until he was right upon us,
even had passed, for the stalk had not properly
started, you see. 'Never mind,' said Baghni, 'the
little Men of a slow wit, the Gonds, will come this
way with their Goru, many of them'; but they
didn't. And save for two old Langurs (monkeys)
that cursed from a pipal tree as we went back to
our <i>Nullah</i>, we saw no Dweller of the Jungle, nor
of the fields. 'The hate of the little Gonds is
coming to us,' growled Bagh. 'And I am so
hungry,' moaned Baghni. 'Baghela should not
have killed any of the Men-kind,' declared my
Sire.</p>

<p>"The Men go to their rest at night, even the
little Gonds, knowing that the Jungle Dwellers will
not come in great numbers to the fields because of
our guard. And it was but an evil chance, too, that
I made a kill of the Gond. But when we were most
hungered, after many days, one night, not far from
our <i>Nullah</i>, was a Bullock tied to a tree. 'Waw-houk!'
exclaimed Baghni, calling her Lord to the
find; 'Che-waugh!' said she, 'here is a Bail of the
Men-kind; make the kill.'</p>

<p>"'It is of their hate,' growled Sher Bagh, 'the
Bullocks do not come of their own way here to the
jungle&mdash;we must be careful.'</p>

<p>"Half the night was gone before we had stalked
all sides of the Goru, but there was nothing&mdash;not
even up in the sal leaves. That was what Baghni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
said, for with her sharp eyes she saw Hookus (big
green pigeon), resting on a branch, which meant
that there was nothing to frighten him. When
Sher Bagh had made the kill, he dragged it far
away from our <i>Nullah</i>. That was most wise, Comrades;
it was so that the Men-kind should not find
our home.</p>

<p>"When our hunger was gone Baghni said, 'We
will eat again when the sun's light passes once
more.' 'No,' growled my Sire, 'we will not come
back to the kill, for the hate of the little Gonds will
be here when they see that we have eaten of the
Goru.'</p>

<p>"That was wise also. To make sure, and to
teach me, a Baghela, Sher Bagh took us down wind
from the drag next night, and the scent of the Men-kind
came strong in our faces. 'Our enemies are
there,' declared Bagh.</p>

<p>"Being a Baghela I thought this fine play, and
by the cunning of my Sire we killed what we found
tied in the Jungle, but never went back to the drag.
Even once in the dark, as we hunted, hearing the
grunt of a Goru, and going up wind to it, Sher
Bagh knew that the Hunters were waiting in the
sal and pipal trees over the bait, so we went back
to the <i>Nullah</i> and rested on lean stomachs."</p>

<p>"Your Sire was too clever for them," commented
Magh, as Tiger ceased speaking for an instant.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was clever," answered Raj Bagh.
"But in two days more something came to us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
no Jungle Dweller can withstand: a full beat of the
Jungles.</p>

<p>"Being but a Baghela," sighed Raj Bagh, "I did
not know what it was when the beat commenced;
I thought that the forest winds were in an evil
temper, but Sher Bagh cried to Baghni, 'Quick!
we must go far, for now comes the hate of the
white-faced kind, for the beat is their way of a
kill.' We lay quiet in our <i>Nullah</i>, thinking they
might pass. 'Tap, tap, tap!' I heard on one side,
much like the klonk, klonk! of Mis-gar (coppersmith
bird). 'What is that?' I asked my Sire.</p>

<p>"'The sal trees cry because they are stricken
by the Beaters,' he answered. 'Tum, tum, tum-m!'
I heard from the other side of the <i>Nullah</i>. 'Is it
the belling of a Nilgai?' I asked. 'The little Gonds
who are of this beat call with their drums,' answered
Sher Bagh. 'All the jungle is falling,' I
cried. 'It is the coming of Hathi,' answered my
Sire, 'for it is a beat of many Hathi. Come,
Baghela, come, Baghni,' he called, and we stole
like frightened Chinkara through the sal and pipal
jungle.</p>

<p>"'To the Baghni-wali nulla!' (tigress valley)
cried Sher Bagh to us as we followed. But as we
sought to enter this place of many caves a Beater
smote at us with the thunder-stick from a tree, but
that was only to frighten us away, for Bagh whispered,
'The Beaters are not to make the kill.'</p>

<p>"'Here will be little spoor for them to follow,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
growled Sher Bagh as we ran. Soon we thought
we had lost those who sought our lives. As we
rested for a little while in some thick, wild plum
bushes they came all about us. There were many
Hathi, and on three of the Hathi were little
caves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haudas," corrected Elephant. "That is the
way the Men-kind ride on my back when we are
in the beat."</p>

<p>"And the Men had thunder-sticks with which
they smote Sher Bagh and Baghni. 'Waw, waw-houk!'
roared my Sire when he was struck&mdash;'Che-waugh!'
he cried to me, 'flee, Baghela, while I
charge.' With a rush he sprang on a big Hathi's
nose, and I think he got even to the hauda, for the
Hathi turned and ran, screaming with pain; and
I, seeing this, broke from my cover and charged
back through the Beaters who were on foot. Just
in my path I saw one of the Beaters striking two
sticks together. Being cross because of my hot
pads, and what they had done to Sher Bagh, I
seized this one, and took him with me.</p>

<p>"After that, I lived alone, and because the
Jungle Dwellers had fled from those parts, and because
of the wrong we had from these Gonds, I
became a Man-killer, eating that which was put
in my reach."</p>

<p>"How did they catch you?" questioned Wolf.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;MY SIRE ... SPRANG ON A BIG HATHI&#39;S NOSE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Because I sought to change my way of life,"
answered Bagh, "and leaving the Man-kill I made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to satisfy my hunger with a Goat. I heard the
Goat cry at night-time," continued Bagh, "and
after a careful stalk, finding nothing of the presence
of Man, I sprang on Bakri the Goat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the Goat captured you," cried Magh, gleefully.</p>

<p>"Together we fell into a deep hole that had been
dug by the evil little Gonds. Though I ate the
Bakri I could not get out again, and in the morning
the Men were all about me, both white and black.
How the little Men reviled me! But it seemed the
Sahibs wanted to take me alive, so they dug another
hole close to the one in which I was, put a
big wooden cage with a door to it down, and then
with long spears broke through the walls between
the cage and the hole I was in. Of course, I was
glad enough to go any place; besides, they threw
down on me their dreadful fire. I sprang in the
cage and the door dropped behind me. Then many
of the Men-kind pulled the cage out with ropes,
and I was sent here to Sa'-zada."</p>

<h2><a name="FIFTH_NIGHT" id="FIFTH_NIGHT"></a><big>FIFTH NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORY OF THE TRIBE OF KING COBRA</h2>


<p>It was the fifth night of the Sa'-zada tales. As
usual, Hathi, Grey Wolf, and all the other
animals, jostling each other merrily like a lot of
schoolboys, had gathered in front of Tiger's cage.</p>

<p>Said the Keeper: "Comrades, you must all be
very careful, for this is Snake's night."</p>

<p>"Oo-o-oh!" whimpered Jackal, "is Nag the
Cobra to come here among us?"</p>

<p>Even Hathi trembled, and blowing softly
through his trumpet, said: "Oh, Sa'-zada, I who
am a Lord of the Jungle, fearing not any Dweller
therein, feel great pains this evening. I am sure
that hay is musty and has disagreed with me. If
you do not mind, Little Brother, I will go back to
my stall and lie down."</p>

<p>"Will Deboia the Climber come also, Little
Master?" asked Magh. "If so, I think my Terrier
Pup is feeling unwell; I will take him to my cage
and wrap him in his blanket. I hate snake stories,
anyway."</p>

<p>"Hiz-z-z!" laughed Python, who was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
there. "Lords of the Jungle indeed! When I
strike or throw a loop, or go swift as the wind
through the Jungle&mdash;Thches-s-s! but I am no
boaster. See our friends. When the smallest of
my kind are to be here each one makes his excuses."</p>

<p>"Never fear, Comrades," Sa'-zada assured the
frightened animals, "Nag the Cobra, and Karait,
and all the others will behave themselves if they
are left alone. Only don't move about, that's
all. The first law when Snakes are about is&mdash;keep
still."</p>

<p>"Yes, we like quietness," assented Python.
"Once there was a fussy old Buffalo Bull who used
to come to my pool and stir up the mud until it was
scarce fit to live in. In the end I threw a loop
around his neck, and he became one of the quietest
Bulls you ever saw in your life."</p>

<p>"Now, Comrades," said Sa'-zada, as he returned
accompanied by the Dwellers of the Snake House,
"Hamadryad, the King Cobra, has promised us a
story."</p>

<p>"Look at my length," cried Hamadryad, drawing
his yellow and black mottled body through
many intricate knots like a skein of colored silk;
"think you I was born this way just as I am? At
first&mdash;that was up in the Yoma Hills in Burma&mdash;I
was not much larger than a good-sized hair from
Tiger's mustache, and since then it has been nothing
but adventure. Even my Mother, where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
had us hid in a pile of rocks covered with ferns,
had to fight for our lives."</p>

<p>"Phuff!" retorted Boar, disdainfully, "many a
nest of Cobra eggs have I rid the world of."</p>

<p>"Not of my kind, I'll warrant," snorted Python,
blowing his foul breath like a small sirocco almost
in Pig's face. "Of Nag, or Hamadryad's family,
perhaps, yes, for, know you, Comrades, what
Nagina does with her eggs? Lays them in the sun
to hatch <i>apsi</i> (of themselves). But my Mother&mdash;ah,
you should have seen her, Comrades; all the
eggs gathered in a heap, and her great, beautiful
body&mdash;much like my own in color&mdash;wound tenderly
about them until the young came forth. Perhaps
a matter of two moons and never a bite for her to
eat all the time. That's what I call being a genuine
Mother."</p>

<p>"Very wise, indeed, and thoughtful," cried the
Salt Water Snake. "My Mother&mdash;well I remember
it&mdash;carried her eggs about in her body till they
were hatched, which seems to me quite as good a
plan. Also, nobody molests us&mdash;if they do, they
die quickly. We all can kill quite as readily as Nag
the Cobra, though there is less talk about us."</p>

<p>"Even so," assented Hamadryad, "the proof of
the matter is in being here; and, as I was going to
say, it is this way with my people; in the hot
weather when there is no rain we burrow in the
ground for months at a stretch. And then the rains
come on and we are driven out of our holes by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the water, and live abroad in the Jungles for a
time. It was at this season of the year I speak of;
I had just come up out of my burrow and was wondrous
hungry, I can tell you; and, traveling, I came
across the trail of a Karait. I followed Karait's
trail, and found him in a hole under a bungalow
of the Men-kind. It was dry under the bungalow,
so I rested after my meal in the hole that had been
Karait's. It was a good place, so I lived there.
Every day a young of the Men-kind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," interrupted Mooswa; "a Boy, eh?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but the old ones called him 'Baba.'
And Baba used to come every day under the bungalow
to play. He threw little sticks and stones
at me; but nothing to hurt, mind you, for he was
small. The things he threw wouldn't have injured
a Fly-Lizard as he crawled on the bungalow posts.
He laughed when he saw me, and called, as he
clapped his little hands, and I wouldn't have hurt
him&mdash;why should I? I don't eat Babas.</p>

<p>"When I heard the heavy feet of the Men I
always slipped in the hole; but, one day, by an evil
chance I was to one side looking for food, and
Baba was following, when his Mother saw me.
Such a row there was, the Men running, and Baba's
Mother calling, and only the little one with no fear.
Surely it was the fear of which Chita and Hathi
have spoken which came over the Men-kind.</p>

<a name="i_090" id="i_090"></a>
<img src="images/i_090.jpg" width="411" height="600" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">&quot;AND BABA USED TO COME EVERY DAY UNDER THE BUNGALOW TO
PLAY....&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"There was one of a great size, like Bear
Muskwa, with a stomach such as Magh's. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
a native baboo. He had a black face, and his voice
was like the trumpet of Hathi; but when I went
straight his way, and rose up to strike, his fat legs
made great haste to carry him far away. Then
I glided in the hole."</p>

<p>"Ghur-ah! it seems a strange tale," snarled
Wolf; "even I would not dare, being alone, to
chase one of the Men-kind."</p>

<p>"It may be true," declared Sa'-zada, "for it is
written in the Book that Hamadryad is the only
Snake that will really chase a man, and show fight."</p>

<p>"I could hear the Men-kind talking and tramping
about," continued King Cobra, "and meant to
lie still till night, and then go away, for I usually
traveled in the dark, you know. But presently
there was a soft whistling music calling me to come
out; and also at times a pleading voice, though of
the Men-kind, I knew that, 'Ho, Bhai (brother),
ho, Raj Naga (King Cobra)! come here, quick,
Little Brother.' Then the soft whistle called me,
sometimes loud, and sometimes low, and even the
noise was twisting and swinging in the air just as
I might myself.</p>

<p>"Hiz-z-z-za! but I commenced to tremble; and
I was full of fear, and I was full of love for the
soft sounds, and with my eyes I wished to see it.
So I came out of the hole, and there was a Black
Man making the soft call from a hollow stick."</p>

<p>"A Snake Charmer with his pipes," exclaimed
Sa'-zada.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"I raised up in anger, thinking that he, too,
would soon run away; but he pointed with his hand,
now this way, from side to side, even as the sweet
sound from the hollow stick seemed to twist and
curl in the air; and following his hand with my
eyes, I commenced to swing as the hand swung.</p>

<p>"'Ho, Little Brother!' he called, 'come here.'</p>

<p>"It was to a basket at his side; for, though I
meant not to do it, I glided into it."</p>

<p>"That was the manner of your taking?" asked
Chita.</p>

<p>"Better than having one's toes squeezed in an
iron trap," declared Jackal.</p>

<p>"Or being beaten by chains," murmured Hathi.</p>

<p>"Yes, the taking was simple enough; but if Baba
had not cried, the Men would have killed me, I
think."</p>

<p>"And that was how you came to Lower Burma?"
asked Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Hamadryad, "this man who
made music with the hollow stick took me with him,
and at every place where there were any of his
fellows he brought me forth from the basket, and
made me dance to his music. That was what he
called it&mdash;dance."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you bite him?" queried Rattler,
making his tail rattles sing in anger.</p>

<p>"He pulled out my fangs," declared Hamadryad.</p>

<p>"He-he," sneered Magh; "now surely it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
great lie, this wondrous tale of Cobra's, for in his
mouth are the very fangs he says the black-faced
player of music pulled."</p>

<p>"Most wise Ape," said Hamadryad, ironically,
"what your big head, like unto a Jack fruit, does
not understand, is a lie, forsooth. Even though my
teeth were pulled three times, they would grow
again; but you do not know that&mdash;therefore it is
a lie. Even now, behind these that you see, and
perhaps yet may feel if you keep on, are others
waiting the time when these may be broken. Was
it not Hathi said some wise animal arranged all
these things for us?"</p>

<p>"Sa'-zada says it is God," interrupted Hathi.</p>

<p>"This man made me fight with a Mongoos, that
those of his kind might laugh."</p>

<p>"What is a Mongoos?" queried Magh.</p>

<p>"Our natural enemy," answered King Cobra,
"just as Fleas and other Vermin are yours. But I
killed the squeaky little beast with one drive of
my head&mdash;broke his back. At Ramree a Sahib
bought me from the black man."</p>

<p>"That was the Sahib who sent you here, I
fancy," suggested Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. At any rate he seemed fond of
Snakes of my kind, for he put me in a box wherein
was one of my family. But he should have known
more about our manner of life, for he nearly
starved us through ignorance of our taste. He
puts Rats and Frogs, and Birds and such Vermin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
as that in, with never so much as a Green-Tree-Snake.
The yellow-faced Burmans used to come
in front of our cage and touch us up with sticks
until my nose was skinned with striking at them
and hitting the bars.</p>

<p>"Our getting something to eat was a pure accident.
One night this Sahib stepped on a Snake&mdash;a
young Rock Snake, which had curled up in the
path for the warmth of the hot earth. 'Oh, ho!'
said the Sahib, bringing this new Snake to our cage,
'you are looking for trouble, little <i>Samp</i> (snake).
Let us see how you get on in there,' and he threw
him in our box, expecting to see a fight."</p>

<p>"And did he?" queried Magh.</p>

<p>"Hiz-z-z-za! I should say so. My mate and I
fought half an hour before we settled who was to
eat the visitor."</p>

<p>"You two Comrades fought over it?" asked
Mooswa.</p>

<p>"Yes; that is our way. Two Snakes cannot eat
one&mdash;how else should we settle the question? we
were both hungry. Why, one day my mate flew
at me, and I could see in his eye that he meant
eating me, and in self-defence I was forced to put
him out of the way of mischief, but the Sahib
pulled us apart.</p>

<p>"But if I hated the Yellow Men who came to
my cage, I liked the Mem-Sahib (white lady). I
think it was her voice. Hiz-z, hiz-z, hiz-z! It
was as soft as the song the man had brought forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
from the hollow stick. Sometimes I would hear
her voice-song near my box, and it would put me to
sleep; only, of course, I had to keep one eye open
lest my mate would try to eat me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had no idea Snakes were so fond of each
other," said Magh, maliciously.</p>

<p>"Yes; I think I should have eaten <i>him</i> to have
saved that worry. But I must tell you about the
Mem-Sahib and the Cook. He was small and so
black&mdash;a perfect little Pig. One day when the
Sahib was away, the Cook became possessed of
strange devils."</p>

<p>"Became drunken on his Master's liquor, I suppose,"
remarked Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, for he came and took me out of the
box, wound me around his shoulders and waist, and
went with a clamor of evil sounds, in to my Mem-Sahib."</p>

<p>"Just like a Man," sneered Pardus.</p>

<p>"Even I was ashamed," continued Hamadryad.
"My Mem-Sahib cried out with fear, and her eyes
were dreadful to look into.</p>

<p>"I glided twice about the Man-devil's neck, and
drew each coil tight and tight and tighter, and
swung my head forward until I looked into his
eyes, and I nodded twice thus," and the King Cobra
swayed his vicious black head back and forth with
the full suggestiveness of a death thrust, until each
one of the animals shivered with fear.</p>

<p>"I think he died of the Man-fear Hathi has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
spoken of, for I did not strike him&mdash;it may be that
the coils about his throat were over-tight. But I
glided back to my box, and I think the Mem-Sahib
knew that I did not wish to even make her afraid."</p>

<p>"Most interesting," declared Sa'-zada. "Is that
all, Cobra?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm tired. Let Python talk."</p>

<p>The huge Snake uncoiled three yards of his
length, slipped it forward as easily, as noiselessly
as one blows smoke, shoved his big flat head up
over the Keeper's knee, ran his tongue out four
times to moisten his lips, and said: "I am also
from the East, and I do not like this land. Here
my strength is nothing, for I can't eat. A Chicken
twice a month&mdash;what is that to one of my size?
Sa'-zada will eat as much in a day; and yet in my
full strength I could crush five such as our Little
Brother. Many loops! in my own Jungle I could
wind myself about a Buffalo and pull his ribs together
until his whole body was like loose earth.
I have done it. Sa'-zada knows that for months
and months after I came I ate nothing, and in the
end they took me out on the floor there, six of them,
and shoved food down my throat with a stick.</p>

<p>"Once I had run down a Barking Deer, and
swallowed him, and was having a little sleep, when
I wandered into the most frightful sort of nightmare.
It came to me in my sleep that Bagh had
charged me of a sudden, and gripped my throat in
his strong jaws. I opened my eyes in fright, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
sure enough, I was being choked with a rope in
the hands of the Men-kind. Each end of it was
fastened to a long bamboo, and the Men were on
either side of me. I made the leaves and dry wood
in that part of the Jungle whirl for a little, but it
was no use&mdash;I couldn't get away. Also a man of
the White-kind was sitting on a laid tree, and in
his hands was a loud-voiced gun. But I nearly
paid him out for some of the insult. They dragged
me on to the road, and I lay there quiet and simple-looking.
He thought I was asleep, I suppose. At
any rate he came up and touched me on the nose
with his toe.</p>

<p>"I struck; but, though I knew it not, the rope
was tight held by one of the Yellow-kind who stood
behind me, and I but got a full choking; though,
as I have said, the other, he of the White Face,
was stricken with fear.</p>

<p>"They put me in a box, but though I have no
appetite here, I could eat there, and they gave me
so many chickens that I shed my beautiful skin
almost monthly. I nearly died from the over-diet,
not being used to such plenty."</p>

<p>"Tell us of your food-winning in the Jungle,"
craved Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Though I go wondrous swift," began Python,
"yet if any of the Deer-kind passed me on foot I
could not catch them. Because of this I was forced
to take great thought to outwit them. You, Gidar,
and you, Hathi, know of the elephant creeper that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
is in all those Jungles, how it runs from tree to
tree for many a mile&mdash;so strong that it sometimes
pulls down the biggest wood-grower. Well,
having knowledge of a Deer's path, I would stretch
my body across it much after that fashion, and the
silly creatures with their ribbed faces, always
coughing a hoarse bark, and always possessed of a
stupid fear, would walk right into my folds, thinking
me a part of the creeper. Once, even, as I
think of it, a hunter&mdash;of the White-kind he was&mdash;ate
his food sitting on a coil of my body as I lay
twisted about a tree. To tell you the truth, I was
asleep, having fed well, and only woke up because
of his sticking his cutting knife into my back, thinking,
of course, he was standing it in the wood,
when I suddenly squirmed and upset him, and his
food and drink.</p>

<p>"But when it was the dry season and the leaves
were off the trees, the Jungle was so open that even
the silly Deer could see the rich color of my beautiful
skin, and for days and days I went hungry.
Then I would go to the small water ponds, <i>Jheels</i>,
and curling my tail about a tree on one side, put
myself across, and catching a tree on the other side
with my teeth, swing my body back and forth and
throw the water all out on the land. Then I would
eat all the Fish-dwellers, and go to sleep for a week.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;I WOULD STRETCH MY BODY ACROSS IT MUCH AFTER THAT FASHION.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Once in a land of many pigs, I worked for days
and days in that part of the Jungle bending down
small trees, and arranging the creepers until I had
a <i>keddah</i> with two long sides running far out into
the Jungle. Then, going beyond, I made a great
noise, rushing up and down, and many of these
Dwellers being possessed of fear, fled into the
<i>keddah</i> and I devoured them."</p>

<p>Chita sat on his haunches and looked at Python
in astonishment, his big black head low hung,
and a sneer of great unbelief on his mustached
lips.</p>

<p>"Surely this is the one great liar!" he exclaimed.
"If these things be not written in the Book, then
Python has most surely had such a dream as he
has told us of."</p>

<p>"Without doubt it is a lie," declared Magh, "but
for my part I am ready to believe anything of his
kind. In my Jungle home never once did I climb
out on a tree limb without pinching it to see
whether it was wood or a vile thing such as yon
mottled boaster."</p>

<p>"Are the stories of Python written in the Book,
O Sa'-zada?" queried Mooswa.</p>

<p>"No," answered the Keeper, "but Python may
have had this strange manner of life."</p>

<p>"Whether they be true tales or false tales,"
hissed Python, "I am now tired, and they are at an
end."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sa'-zada, stroking the glistening
scales of the big Snake's head, "it is time to cage
up now. Perhaps we'll all have strange dreams to-night."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon the animals were sound asleep, all but
Magh, who spent an hour chattering to Blitz, her
Fox Terrier Pup, on the enormity of telling false
tales.</p>

<h2><a name="SIXTH_NIGHT" id="SIXTH_NIGHT"></a><big>SIXTH NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORY OF THE MONKEYS</h2>


<p>Such a row there had been all day in Animal
Town.</p>

<p>Sa'-zada, the Keeper, had told Magh, the
Orang-outang, that the Monkeys were to tell
stories that night at the usual meeting. That was
the cause of the excitement.</p>

<p>All day the Monkeys, living in a row of cages
like dwellers in tenement houses, had chattered to
each other through the bars, and admonished one
another to think of just the cleverest things any of
their family or ancestors had ever done.</p>

<p>"We are like the Men-kind," Magh kept repeating;
"we are the Bandar-log, the Jungle People.</p>

<p>"Listen, Comrades, what is my name even?
Orang-outang, which means Chief of the Jungle
People.</p>

<p>"See, even I have my Dog, as do the Men-kind,"
and she held up Blitz, the Fox-Terrier Pup, by the
ear until he squealed and bit her in the arm. "See,
he has bitten me even as he would a man," she
cried, triumphantly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Two doors down were three little brown Monkeys
caged with an Armadillo who looked like a
toy, iron-plated gun-boat.</p>

<p>"Oh, we are people who think," cried one of
these, pouncing down on the Armadillo. The little
gun-boat drew his armor plate down about him
like a Mud-turtle. The Monkey caught the side
of it with his hand, lifted it up, bit the Armadillo
in the soft flesh, and raced up on his shelf where he
chattered: "Oh, we are the people who think.
That is not instinct&mdash;my father was never caged
with an Armadillo."</p>

<p>At last night came, and Sa'-zada, throwing down
bars and opening cages, had gathered as usual his
animal friends in front of Tiger's cage.</p>

<p>"Ho, Little Brother," began Black Panther,
speaking to Sa'-zada, "why should we who are
great in our own jungles listen to these empty-headed
Bandar-log? Was there ever any good at
their hands?"</p>

<p>"Oo-oo! A-huk, a-huk!" cried Hanuman, "you
of all the thieving slayers should know of that
matter. How many times have you been saved
from danger because of our watchfulness&mdash;and
also Bagh the Killer! Many a hard drive, the
hunt drive of the Men-kind, has come to nothing
because of us&mdash;because we never sleep. When
your stomach is full you sleep soundly, trusting to
a warning from us, the Bandar-log. Nothing can
be done in the jungles that we do not know. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
do we steal silently away as is your method? Not
a bit of it. By the safety of Jungle-dwellers! we
give the cry of beware! Listen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"A-huk, a-huk! Chee-chee-chee! Waugh,
waugh, a-huk!" and the voice of the gray-whiskered,
black-faced ape reverberated on the dead
night air through the houses of Animal Town like
the clangor of a cracked bell.</p>

<p>"That is quite true," declared Mor, the Peacock;
"I also am one of the Jungle Watchers&mdash;though
I get little credit for it. None of the
Dwellers thank us; and sometimes in their anger
the Sahibs who are making the drive shoot us for
our trouble, saying that we have spoiled sport.
Many a jungle life have I saved through my cry
of 'Miaou! Miaou!'"</p>

<p>"Disturbers of sleep!" sneered Black Panther;
"there is little to choose between you&mdash;you're a
noisy lot of beggars."</p>

<p>"You are hardly fair, Pardus," remonstrated
Sa'-zada. "I quite believe what Hanuman says,
for it is well known that some of the Monkey-tribe
saved Gibraltar to the British by their watchfulness,
and the men are more grateful than you, for
to this day monkeys are protected and made much
of there."</p>

<p>"It was my people did that," cried Magot, the
Rock Ape, blinking his deep, narrow-set eyes. "We
have lived there for a long time."</p>

<p>"And in Benares, where I lived once, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
people of great honor," added a white-whiskered
Monkey. "I should like to see Black Pardus harm
one of us there."</p>

<p>The speaker was Entellus, the sacred Hanuman
Monkey, whose rights of protection in the City of
Temples, Benares, was almost greater than that
of the human dwellers.</p>

<p>"You can't twiddle your thumbs! You can't
twiddle your thumbs!" cried Cockatoo, mockingly.</p>

<p>"But I can see my under lip," retorted Magh,
angrily, sticking it out and looking down at it, "and
that's more than you can do, with your lobster's
claw of a nose."</p>

<p>Cockatoo had hit the truth about the thumbs,
for no ape can make them go around, only in and
out straight to the palm. This matter of thumbs
is the great line of defence between man and his
disputed Simian ancestor.</p>

<p>"Our manner of life," began Hanuman, in the
little silence that ensued, "is to live in the tree-tops.
Our families are raised there, and we are seldom
on the ground."</p>

<p>"No, the ground is a dangerous place," concurred
Chimpanzee; "Leopards, and Snakes, and
Men, and evil things of that sort about all the
time. I, too, build a little house in the strong
branches of a tree, and live there until the fruit
gets scarce; then, of course, I have to go to a new
part and build another."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought I was the only animal that had sense
enough to build a house," grunted Wild Boar.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are," said Chimpanzee; "I'm no
animal."</p>

<p>"You are a Monkey&mdash;&mdash;" began Boar, apologetically.</p>

<p>"I'm not a Monkey," insisted the other, very
haughtily; "they go in droves. But we, who are
the Jungle People, build houses and have a wife
and family just like the Men."</p>

<p>"You can't twiddle your thumbs!" shrieked
Cockatoo; but Hathi reached up with his trunk
and tweaked the bird's nose before he could repeat
the taunt.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," began Hooluk, solemnly,
"there was a great Raja sore troubled because those
of my kind, the Apes, ate all the grain and fruit
in his country. To be sure, it was a year of much
starvation. And the King commanded that all the
Bandar-log should be killed.</p>

<p>"Then Hanuman, the wise Ape, who was our
cousin, asked of my people what might be done;
but we, being tender-hearted, and not knowing
how to pacify the King, hung with our heads down
and wept in misery.</p>

<p>"Now this gave Hanuman, who is most wise, an
idea. He ordered all the other Bandar-log to go far
into the jungles and hide, while we were to remain
and lament, and declare that our friends were
dead. The Raja, hearing our sad cry, relented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and commanded that the killing should cease. And
since that time we have always cried thus, and our
faces have been black, and all because of the dark
sins of the other Bandar-log."</p>

<p>"Was there ever such a lie&mdash;&mdash;" began Pardus;
but Jackal interrupted him, declaring that he, too,
cried at night because of the wickedness of other
Jungle Dwellers.</p>

<p>"By my lonesome life!" muttered Mooswa. "I
have heard the Loon cry on Slave Lake, but for
a real, depressing night noise commend me to Hooluk.
I have no doubt his tale is quite true, a cry
such as he has could not have been given him for
amusement."</p>

<p>"Scratch my head!" cried Cockatoo; "I think
Hooluk's tale is quite true, for even I, who am
only appreciated because of my beauty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hide your nose," croaked Kauwa, the Crow.</p>

<p>"Because of my beauty," resumed Cockatoo, "I
once saved the life of all my Master's family. The
bungalow was on fire and they were asleep. Scree-ya
ah-ah!' I cried; then, 'Quick, Pootai, bring the
water&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"To be famous one must needs know a great lie
and tell it," snarled Pardus, disagreeably. "The
way of all Jungle Dwellers is to kill something;
but here are pot-bellied, empty-headed Apes, and
Birds of little sense, all boasting of saving lives."</p>

<p>"Let me talk," cried Water Monkey, scratching
his ribs with industry. "If I tell not true tales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
then call Hornbill, and Jackal, and King Cobra
to stand against me, for we are all of the same
land. We were a big family, a full hundred of
us at least, and every way was our way&mdash;water, and
land, and tree-top. We ate fruits, and nuts, and
grains, and things that are cast up by the waters.
Talking of fishing, you should have seen my
mother. When the sea had gone back from the
shore we would all troop down. When the Crabs
saw us coming they would scuttle into holes and
under rocks, and we'd catch every Crab on the
shore. It was my mother taught me the trick&mdash;wise
old lady; I'd shove my tail under the rock,
the Crab would lay hold of it, and then out he'd
come.</p>

<p>"Oh, there was good eating on those shores.
Fat Oysters the size of a banana. It was mother
showed me how to take a stone in my hand, and
break them off the rocks. And, as Magh has said,
we are much like the men, for not one of our family
would eat an Oyster until he had washed it in the
water.</p>

<p>"But we poor people had lots of trials. Crossing
the streams was worst of all. If we made the
Monkeys bridge from tree to tree, like as not Python
would be lying in wait to pick off one of our
number. And if we walked across on the bottom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Walked on the bottom!" cried Sa'-zada, in
astonishment.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, we never swim; we always walk across
on the bottom; though, sometimes, of course, we
floated over on logs; but that was very dangerous
because of Magar the Crocodile."</p>

<p>"Ghurrgle-ugle-ugle, uh-hu!" said Sher Abi,
"the long-tailed one is right. I could tell a true
story touching that matter. Whuff-f-f! but it was
a hot day. I was lying with my wife in the water
near the bank. I was hungry&mdash;I am always hungry;
and getting food in a small way is wearisome
to one of my heavy habit. I was resting, and
Black-head the Magar Bird was running about
inside of my jaws catching Flies for his dinner.
And, while I think of it, while I am by no means
vain of my sweet nature, I claim it was most good
of me to hold my heavy lips open for him. Suddenly
Black-head gave his little cry of warning to
me and flew up in the air. 'Something is coming,'
I whispered to Abni, my wife; and, sure enough,
it was the Bandar-log, the Water Monkeys, chattering
and yelling, and knocking down fruit from
the trees as though the whole jungle belonged to
them.</p>

<p>"'The old trick,' I whispered to Abni; 'float
across like a log.' You know I can look wondrous
like a log when I try; and a dinner of the Bandar-log,
even, was not to be despised in a time of great
hunger.</p>

<p>"'Chee-chee, a-houp-a-houp, chickety-chee-chee!'
You'd have thought their throats would split with
the uproar when they saw one log floating across
and another just starting.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Oh, ho!' cried the leader, swinging by his tail
from a limb of the Mangrove tree, and peering
down at me; 'the wind is driving all the dead trees
from this side to the other. Get aboard, children,
quick.' And they all clambered on to my back,
shoving and pushing like a lot of Jackal pups&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have I not said it," cried Gidar, the Jackal,
"that Sher Abi is a devourer of our young? Jackal
pups&mdash;murderer!"</p>

<p>"Half way across," resumed Sher Abi, "I opened
an eye to take a squint at the general condition of
these Bandar-log, as to which might be fat and
which might be lean, and, would you believe it, the
leader of these fool people saw me looking, and
screamed with fright. I closed all the valves of
nostrils and eyes and sank in the water. The
Bandar-log were so excited that more than half of
them jumped into my jaws, and Abni, who came
back, hearing the noise, took care of the others.
Eh-hu! Gluck! Monkeys are stupid, but not bad
eating."</p>

<p>"Listen to that, Comrades," cried Water
Monkey. "Sher Abi the Poacher boasts of killing
my people. Have I not said that our life is one
of danger? He and Python are as bad as Men.
My mother was killed by a Man, and all for the
sake of a few mangoes."</p>

<p>"But how are we to know that Mango-tree was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
not as others in the Jungle?" pleaded Monkey.
"True it grew close to a bungalow, but what of
that? Close to the Jungle, trees and bungalows
are so mixed up that nobody knows which is free
land and which is bond land. Have I not seen
even the Men-kind frightened over such matters,
and killing each other. But, as I have said, this
Man, who was a Sahib, shot my mother as she was
in a tree. She clung to a limb, and, young as I
was, I helped her, holding on to her arms. All
day she cried, and cried, and cried, just as you have
heard the young of the Men-kind; and all night
she cried, too. In the morning the Sahib came out,
and I heard him say that he hadn't slept all night
because of the wailing that was like a babe's. When
he looked up at my mother she became so afraid
that she fell dead at his feet. Peeping down
through the leaves I saw the fear look that Hathi
has spoken of come into the Man's eyes, only they
did not look evil as they had when he pointed the
fire-stick at us. I swung down from branch to
branch to my mother, and sitting beside her, cried
also, being but a little chap and all alone in the
Jungle. Then the Man took me up in his arms
and said: 'Poor little Oungea. It was a shame to
kill the old girl; I feel like a murderer&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"He took me into the bungalow and I had a fine
life of it, though he taught me many things that
were evil."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that," sneered Pardus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Impossible! Caw-w!" laughed Kauwa.</p>

<p>"What evil tricks are there left to teach the
Bandar-log?" queried Hathi.</p>

<p>"He taught me to drink gin," answered Oungea;
"at first a little gin and much sugar, and after a
time I could take it without sugar."</p>

<p>"This rather bears out Magh's claim that you
Jungle People are like the Men," said Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Still it was not good for me, this gin," continued
Oungea; "leaving one's head full of much
soreness in the morning. But, of course, being
young, I was possessed of much mischief that was
not of the Sahib's teaching."</p>

<p>"He-he! no doubt, no doubt," cried Hornbill,
"it was those of your kind, both young and old,
who plucked the feathers from my children once
upon a time. Plaintain-at-a-gulp! but their appearance
was unseemly. You can imagine what I
should look like with my prominent nose and no
feathers."</p>

<p>"My Master carried in his pocket something
that was forever crying 'tick, tick, tick.' I felt
sure there must be Lizards or Spiders, or other
sweet ones of a small kind within; but one day
when I had a fair opportunity and pulled it apart,
cracking it with a stone as I had the Oysters, I got
no eating at all, but in the end a sound beating.</p>

<p>"Once I ate the little berries that grow on the
sticks that cause the fire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Matches," suggested Sa'-zada.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps; I thought they were berries. Many
pains! but I was sick, and my kind Master saved
my life with cocoanut oil."</p>

<p>"Magh knows something of that matter," declared
Sa'-zada; "when she first came here she ate
her straw bedding and it nearly killed her."</p>

<p>"A fine record these Jungle People have,"
sneered Pardus. "I, who claim not to be wise like
the Men, have sense enough to stick to my meat."</p>

<p>"But Magh was wise," asserted Sa'-zada, "for
if she had not helped us in every way when we
were trying to save her life she would surely have
died."</p>

<p>"In my Master's house," said Oungea, "was one
of their young, a Babe; and whenever I got loose,
for they took to tying me up, I made straight for
his bed, borrowed his bottle of milk&mdash;there surely
was no harm in that, for we were babes together&mdash;and
scuttled up a tree where I could drink the
milk in peace. When I dropped the bottle down
so that they might get it, it always broke, and I
think it was because of this mischief that they
whipped me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sa'-zada, "we were to have learned
to-night why the Bandar-log were Men of the Jungle,
first cousins to the Men-kind; but all I remember
is that they ate matches and straw and got very
sick. For my part I am very sleepy."</p>

<p>"If you are tired, I will carry you, Hanuman,"
lisped Python, shoving his ugly fat head forward.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even I, who find it a labor to walk on the land,
will give any Monkey who seeks it a ride," sighed
Sher Abi. "This talking of eating has made me
hung&mdash;&mdash;I mean ready to put myself out for my
friends."</p>

<p>"Take your friends in, you mean," snarled
Gidar, jumping back as the heavy jaws of the
Crocodile snapped within an inch of his nose.</p>

<p>"I think each one will look after himself," declared
Sa'-zada; "it will be safer. All to your
cages."</p>

<h2><a name="SEVENTH_NIGHT" id="SEVENTH_NIGHT"></a><big>SEVENTH NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORY OF BIRDS OF A FEATHER</h2>


<p>When Sa'-zada the Keeper had gathered
all his comrades in front of Chita's cage
for the evening of the Bird talk, Magh clambered
up on her usual perch, Hathi's head, expostulating
against the folly of throwing the meeting open to
such gabblers.</p>

<p>"Never mind," remarked Black Panther, "it's
the great talkers that are thought most of here, I
see. We, who have accomplished much, having
earned an honest living, but are not over ready with
the tongue, amount to but little."</p>

<p>"Scree-he-ah-h!" cried Cockatoo. "By my crest!
I am surely the oldest one here; shall I begin, O
Sa'-zada?"</p>

<p>"Cockatoo was born in Australia," declared Sa'-zada;
"at least The Book says so, but the record
of his age only goes back a matter of forty years."</p>

<p>"Just so," concurred the Cockatoo, "and from
there I went to India on a ship; and for downright
evil words there is no Jungle to compare with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
ship. Why, damn it&mdash;excuse me, friends, even the
memory of my voyage causes me to swear.</p>

<p>"My master, who was Captain of the ship, gave
me to one of the Women-kind in Calcutta&mdash;'Mem-Sahib'
the others called her. There I had just the
loveliest life any poor exiled Cockatoo could wish
for; it makes me swear&mdash;weep, I mean&mdash;when I
think of the sweet Eatings she had for me. Not
but that Sa'-zada is kind, only no one but a Woman
knows how to look after a Cockatoo. At tiffin I
was always allowed to come on the table, and the
Mem-Sahib would take the cream from the top of
the milk and give it to me. The Sahib threw
pieces of bread at my head, which is like a Man's
way, having no regard for the dignity of a
Cockatoo.</p>

<p>"One day, being frightened because of something,
I fluttered to the top of his head, which was
all bare of feathers, and verily I believe the Man-fear,
of which Hathi has spoken, came to my new
master. I could almost fancy I was back on the
ship, for his language was much like that of the
fo'castle.</p>

<p>"Potai was the sweeper, a low-caste Hindoo of
an evil presence; and save for the fact that he wore
no foot-covering I should have been in a bad way.
When the Mem-Sahib was not looking he beat me
with his broom, simply because, that often being
lonesome, I'd call aloud, 'Potai! Potai!' just to
see him come running from the stables.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thinking to break him of his evil habit of
beating me, many times I hid behind the <i>purda</i> of
a door waiting for the coming of his ugly toes.
Swisp! swisp! I'd hear the broom; 'Uh-h, uh-h!'
old Potai would grunt, because of the stooping, and
presently under the <i>purda</i>, which hung straight
down, would peep his low-caste toes.</p>

<p>"Click! just like that I'd nip quick, and run for
the Mem-Sahib, screaming that Potai was beating
me. I'm sure it was not an evil act on my part,
for if any Sahib saw it he would laugh, and give
me nuts or something sweet. That was because
everyone knew that Potai was evil and of a low
caste.</p>

<p>"Many a time I saved the tiffin from the thieving
crows&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Caw-w-w, what-a yar-r-r-n!" growled Kauwa
the Crow. "We who are the cleaners of cities are
not thieves. What is a Cockatoo? A teller of
false tales and a breaker of rest."</p>

<p>"Ca-lack! even what Cockatoo has said of
Kauwa is true," declared the Adjutant, solemnly,
snapping his sword in its scabbard; "I, who am <i>the</i>
cleaner of cities, consider Kauwa but a thief. Once
many of the Seven Sisters, for that is the evil name
of Kauwa's tribe, stole a full-flavored fish from my
very teeth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, aw, aw! let me tell it, let me tell it," cried
Kauwa; "let me tell the true tale of my solemn
friend's stealing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now we shall get at the real history of the
Feathered Kind," chuckled Pardus. "When the
Jungle Dwellers fall out amongst themselves and
make much clatter, there is always the chance of
an easy Kill."</p>

<p>"Caw-aw-aw! It was this way," fairly snapped
Crow. "A seller of small things, a <i>box wallah</i>, walking
in an honest way fast after the <i>palki</i> of a great
Sahib, even on the Red Road of Calcutta, by chance
was struck by another <i>palki</i> and his box of many
things thrown to the ground. Then this honest
one of the straight face, Adjutant, seeing the mishap
from his perch on the lion which is over the
Viceroy's gate, swooped down like a proper Dacoit
and swallowed some brown Eating which was
like squares of butter, and made haste back to his
perch. Even a Crow would have known better
than that, for it was soap. And all day many of
the Men-kind stood and looked at our baldheaded
friend, for a great sickness came to him; and as
he coughed, soap-bubbles floated upward. The
Hindoos said it was a work of their gods."</p>

<p>"Just what I thought," grunted Pardus; "all
clatter, and no true story of anything."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Cockatoo wearily, "my Mem-Sahib
always put me in a little house on the veranda
at night. Though I didn't like it at all, still
it was <i>my</i> house, and one day, in the midst of a
rain, when I sought to enter, inside were two of
the Cat young."</p>

<p>"Kittens?" queried Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Ee-he-ah; and just behind me the old Cat with
another in her mouth. Hard nuts! but such a row
you never heard in your life. When I tried to
drag the Kittens out, the Cat dug her beak&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Claws, you mean," corrected Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Ee-he-ah&mdash;claws in my back; but the Mem-Sahib
took them away."</p>

<p>"Ugh, ugh! all lies! Bird talk!" grunted Boar.
"What say you, Sa'-zada?"</p>

<p>"It is true," declared the Keeper, much to the
disgust of his questioner; "for in The Book are also
other true tales of Cockatoo. The Mem-Sahib has
written that he was a great mischief-maker. She
says that on the back veranda of her bungalow was
a filter, and when 'Cocky' wanted a bath, he used
to turn the tap, but never knew enough to shut it
off, so the filter was always running dry.</p>

<p>"Also, there was a guava tree in the compound,
and our friend ate all the guavas just as they ripened,
so no one but Cocky got any of the fruit.
That he was always fighting with Jock, her Scotch
Terrier, and the clamor fair made her head ache."</p>

<p>"Whatever Sa'-zada reads from The Book is
most certainly true," commented Magh.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," began the Adjutant,
solemnly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You look like it," growled Wolf.</p>

<p>"Of a story about Kauwa," continued the
Adjutant&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"He stole three silver spoons from my Mem-Sahib,"
interrupted Cocky hastily, suddenly remembering
the incident, "and hid them in the Dog-cart,
where they were found next day; which shows
that he is neither wise nor honest."</p>

<p>"Mine is a true tale," declared Adjutant, with
great dignity. "One morning, looking calmly over
the great city to see that all had been tidied up,
I saw my little black friend, whose voice is like
unto the squeak of a Bullock-cart, crouched in an
open window, with wings well spread ready for
flight.</p>

<p>"'A new piece of thieving,' thought I, and,
drawing closer, I saw Kauwa hop to the floor, pass
over to a bed on which slept a Sahib, and gently
take a slice of toast from the top of a cup; then
away went the thief.</p>

<p>"But the full wickedness was later, for when the
Sahib awoke he spoke to his servant in the manner
which Cockatoo has related of the ship. And when
the other, who was of the Black Kind, declared
he had put the toast beside his Master, the Sahib
beat him for a liar. Even three mornings did
Kauwa take the toast; but on the fourth the Sahib,
who was pretending to sleep, nearly broke his back
with the cast of a boot."</p>

<p>"Jungle Dwellers are Jungle Dwellers, and City
Dwellers are City Dwellers," commenced Hornbill,
gravely, "and I'm so glad I'm a Jungle
Dweller. These tales show what city life is like.
Save for an occasional row with Magh's friends,
Hanuman and the rest, whose stomachs are out of
all proportion to the quantity of fruit to be had,
I have led a very peaceful life in the Jungle."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;LEAVING JUST A PLACE FOR HER SHARP BEAK.&quot;</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me," queried Magh, maliciously, "do your
Young roost on your nose?"</p>

<p>"No; that is to keep inquisitive folks at a distance.
And, talking of Young, when my wife has
laid her two big eggs in a hole in some tree, I shut
her up there with the eggs&mdash;make her stay home
to mind the house and the oncoming family. I
plaster up the hole with mud, leaving just a place
for her sharp beak; this to keep the Monkeys from
stealing her and the eggs."</p>

<p>"Kaw-aw-aw! Talking of nests," said Kauwa,
"when I was in Calcutta I designed a nest that
would last forever&mdash;yes, forever. Each year before
that time, because of the monsoon winds, my
nest had always been destroyed; but the time I
speak of, having a job on hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On beak, you mean!" laughed Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Aw-haw!&mdash;to clean up about a cook-house behind
a certain place of the Sahib's in which they
bottled water of a fierce strength&mdash;as I say, being
busy in this same compound, I spied many, many
twigs of wire."</p>

<p>"What's wire?" asked Mooswa; "I've never,
that I know of, eaten such twigs."</p>

<p>Sa'-zada explained, "Kauwa means bottled soda
water, I fancy, and the wire from the corks."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"A thought came to me," continued Kauwa, "to
build my nest of these bright little things, and I
did, first getting my mate's opinion on the matter,
of course. Dead Pigs! but it <i>was</i> a nest! We
would swing, and jump, and hang to it by our
beaks, and never a break in the wall. But I had
forgotten all about the selfish desire of the Men&mdash;but
that was after. The first trouble was when
Cuckoo&mdash;a proper <i>budmash</i> bird she is&mdash;came and
laid two eggs in the nest. I saw the difference in
the eggs at once, but my mate declared that they
were all her own laying. She took rather a pride
in her ability to lay eggs&mdash;to tell you the truth,
we quarreled over it."</p>

<p>"I believe that," yawned Adjutant.</p>

<p>"However, she had her way, and started to
hatch out these foreign devils; but the Men, as
I have said, seeing my beautiful nest, sent a Man
of low caste up the tree, and he took it away,
Cuckoo eggs and all. It was a good joke on the
Cuckoo Bird, and I was so mad at the way everything
turned out, Caw-ha! I never made it again."</p>

<p>"I can swallow a plantain at one gulp," said
Hornbill proudly.</p>

<p>"Why do you toss it up first?" asked Sa'-zada,
alluding to the peculiar habit the Hornbill has of
throwing everything into the air, and catching it
as he swallows it.</p>

<p>"It's all in the way of slow eating," answered
Hornbill.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now," said Myna, "it is surely my turn. I,
Myna, who was the pride of the Calcutta Zoo in
the matter of speech, have sat here like a Tucktoo
not saying a word, and listening to such as Cockatoo
boasting about the few paltry oaths he picked
up from the Sailor-kind. Why, damn your eyes,
sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And before Sa'-zada could still the tumult,
Cockatoo and Myna, the best talking Bird of all
India, were hurling the most unparliamentary language
at each other that had ever been bandied
about a Bird gathering.</p>

<p>When Sa'-zada had stopped the indelicate scolding
of the two Birds Myna proceeded to tell of
his life.</p>

<p>"I was born in the Burma hills, amongst the
Shans. That's where I got my beautiful blue-black
coat and lovely yellow beak."</p>

<p>"Modest Bird," sneered Magh.</p>

<p>"It was Mah Thin who snared me; but she was
good to me, though&mdash;rice and fruit, all I could eat;
and she never once forgot to put the turmeric and
ground chillies in my rice; for, you know, if I did
not get something hot in my food I'd soon die. I
was somewhat like Cockatoo in that a Ship-man
bought me and took me to Calcutta. He made me a
most wise bird, and taught me many clever sayings.
And when he was in Calcutta with his ship I would
be put in the Zoo, so that the Sahibs from all parts
might hear my speech.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"One day Tom&mdash;that was my master's name;
he taught me to call him Tom&mdash;said to me, 'To-morrow
the <i>Lat</i> Sahib, the Sirdar, and many ladies
are coming to hear you talk; Myna.' Then he
made me repeat over and over again, 'Good-morning,
your Excellency.'"</p>

<p>"It was a hard word he gave you," commented
Magh.</p>

<p>"It was indeed. Let claw-nosed Cockatoo try it;
he thinks he can talk&mdash;let him try that."</p>

<p>"Avast there, you lubber&mdash;&mdash;" commenced
Cocky, but Sa'-zada stopped him.</p>

<p>"Well, I said it over and over, and over again,
and Tom was so pleased he gave me a graft mango
to eat. Next day the Viceroy and many Mem-Sahibs
and Sahibs gathered about my cage, and the
Viceroy said, 'Good-morning, Polly.' Now this
made me mad&mdash;to be called Polly, as though I had
a hooked nose like Cockatoo; and in my anger
I got excited, and, for-the-love-of-hot-spiced-rice, I
couldn't think of what Tom had told me to say.</p>

<p>"'Speak up!' said Tom.</p>

<p>"In my anger, and forgetting the other thing,
and seeing so many strange faces against the very
bars of my cage, I blurted out, 'I'll see you damned
first!' just as the sailors used to teach me."</p>

<p>"Caw-haw-haw-haw! Very funny, indeed.
Next to a fat bone, or the hiding of a silver spoon,
I like a joke myself," commented Kauwa. "Once
at the first edge of the Hot Time I went to Simla.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
That was also at the time of the going of the
Sahibs, but after Calcutta it was dull&mdash;fair stupid.</p>

<p>"One morning, as I was feeling most lonesome,
I spied a long row of queer little Donkeys standing
with their tails to a fence. They had brought
loads of brick. I flew to the fence, and reaching
far down, pulled the tail of my first Donkey. Much
food! but he did kick&mdash;it made me laugh. I pulled
the tail of every Donkey of the line, and when I
had finished there wasn't a board left on the fence.
Then the Man who was master of the fence, and
the one that was master of the Donkeys, fought
over this matter, and pulled each about by the
feathers that were on their heads. It was the only
real pleasant day I had in Simla."</p>

<p>"Did-you-do-it!" screamed the Redwattled Lapwing,
suddenly roused to animation by falling off
Mooswa's back, where he had been trying to balance
himself with his poor front-toed feet.</p>

<p>"Caw-w-w! I did; and for three grains of corn
I'd pull your tail, too."</p>

<p>"I wasn't speaking to you," retorted Titiri the
Lapwing; "I was dreaming of my old home in India&mdash;dreaming
that the hunters had come into the
rice fields to shoot the poor Paddy Birds and Bakula
(Egret) for their feathers."</p>

<p>"Murderers, you should call them, not Hunters,"
exclaimed Hathi. "It makes me sniff in my
nose now when I think of the Birds I've seen murdered,
just for their feathers."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's an outrageous shame," declared Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"I did all I could," asserted Lapwing. "When
I saw the Gun-men coming, sneaking along,
crouched like Pardus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sneaking like Pardus&mdash;go on, Good Bird!"
chimed in Magh.</p>

<p>"I flew just ahead of them, and cried 'Tee-he-he!
Here come the Murderers!' so that every bird in
all the <i>jhils</i> about could hear me. And when Bakula,
and Kowar the Ibis, and all the others had
flown to safety, I shouted, 'Did-you-do-it, did-you-do-it!'
Then the Men used language much like
the disgraceful talk we have had from Cocky and
Myna to-night."</p>

<p>"You carried a heavy responsibility," remarked
Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"All lies," sneered Kauwa. "Fat Bones! why,
he can't even sit on the limb of a tree."</p>

<p>"That is because of my feet," sighed Lapwing.
"I have no toes behind."</p>

<p>"Where do you sleep?" asked Magh.</p>

<p>"On the ground," answered Lapwing.</p>

<p>"That's so," declared Sa'-zada, "for the Natives
of the East say that Titiri sleeps on his back, and
holds up the sky with his feet."</p>

<p>"But why should the Men kill Birds for a few
feathers?" croaked Vulture. "I don't believe it.
Nobody asked me for one of mine. In fact the
great trouble of all eating is the feathers or skin."</p>

<p>"Whe-eh-eh!" exclaimed Ostrich, disgustedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
"Pheu! your feathers! Even your head looks like a
boiled Lobster. They do not kill me&mdash;the Men&mdash;but
I know they are crazy for feathers, for they
pull mine all out. Some day I'll give one of them a
kick that will cure him of his feather fancy. I
did rake one from beak to feet once with my strong
toe nail. When I bring a foot up over my head
and down like this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Ostrich swung his leg every one skurried out
of the way, for they knew it was like a sword
descending.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Magh, "if you only had a brain
the size of that toe-nail&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop it!" cried Sa'-zada, for this was an unpleasant
truth; Ostrich, though such a huge fellow
himself, has a brain about the size of a Humming
Bird's.</p>

<p>"Talking of Wives," said Ostrich, with the most
extraordinary irrelevance, "mine died when I was
twenty-seven years old; and, of course, as it is the
way with us Birds, I never took up with another,
though I've seen the most beautifully feathered
ones of our Kind&mdash;quite enough to make one's
mouth water.</p>

<p>"She had queer ways, to be sure&mdash;my wife. As
you all know, our way of hatching eggs is turn
about, the Mother Birds sitting all day, while we
Lords of the Nest sit at night. But my wife would
take notions sometimes and not sit at all. In that
case I always sat night and day until the job was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
finished. By-a-sore-breast-bone! but making a
nest in the hard-graveled desert is a job to be
avoided."</p>

<p>"Sore knuckles!" exclaimed Magh, "where are
we at? We were talking of feathers."</p>

<p>"So we were, so we were," decided Mooswa.
"And what I want to know is, do the Men eat the
feathers they hunt for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jungle Dwellers!" exclaimed Magh; "if
you were to sit in my cage for half a day you would
see what they do with them. The Women come
there with their heads covered with all kinds of
feathers, red, and green, and blue&mdash;Silly! how
would I look with my head stuck full of funny old
feathers?"</p>

<p>"Like the Devil!" exclaimed Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Like a Woman," retorted Magh. "And their
hair is so pretty, too. I've seen red hair just like
mine, and then to cover it up with a crest of feathers
like Cockatoo wears; I'd be ashamed of the
thing."</p>

<p>"It's a sin to murder the Birds," whimpered
Mooswa; "that's the worst part of it."</p>

<p>"Tonk, tonk, tonk!" came a noise just like a
small Boy striking an iron telegraph post with a
stick. It was the small Coppersmith Bird clearing
his throat. Very funny the green pudgy little chap
looked with his big black mustaches.</p>

<p>"The Men are great thieves," he asserted.
"When I was a chick my Mother taught me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
stick my tail under my wings for fear they would
steal the feathers as I slept."</p>

<p>"Steal tail feathers!" screamed Eagle; "I should
say they would. Out in the West, where was my
home, when a Man becomes a great Chief he sticks
three of my tail feathers in his hair; and when the
Head Chief of a great Indian tribe rises up to make
a big talk, what does he hold in his hand? The
things that are bright like water-drops&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Diamond rings," exclaimed Sa'-zada, interrupting.</p>

<p>"No; he holds one of my wings to show that
he is great."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are the King Bird, Eagle," concurred
Sa'-zada, "the emblem of our country."</p>

<p>"I can break a lamb's back with my talons,"
assented Eagle, ignoring the sublime disdainfully,
"but I wouldn't trust my nest within reach of any
Man&mdash;they're a lot of thieves."</p>

<p>"Nice feathers are a great trouble," asserted
Sparrow; "I'm glad I haven't any."</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" cried Quail;
"the Men kill me, and I'm sure I'm not gaudy."</p>

<p>"You're good eating, though," chuckled Gidar
the Jackal. "After a day's shoot of the Men-kind,
the scent from their cook-house is fair maddening.
Oh-h-h, ki-yi! I've had many a Quail bone in my
time."</p>

<p>"Even Lapwing can't save <i>us</i> from the Hunters,"
lamented Quail; "they play us such vile tricks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
I've seen a rice field with a dozen bamboos stuck
in it, and on top of each bamboo a cage with a
tame Cock Quail; and in the center, hidden away,
sat a man with a little drum which he tapped with
his fingers. And the drum would whistle 'peep,
peep, peep,' and the Birds in the cages would go
'peep, peep, peep,' and we Cock Birds of the Jungle,
thinking it a challenge to battle, would answer
back, 'peep, peep, peep,' and go seeking out these
strange Birds who were calling for fight. Of
course, our Wives would go with us to see the
battle, and in the end all would be snared or shot
by the deceitful Men."</p>

<p>"That's almost worse than being taken for one's
feathers," said Egret. "I'm glad they don't
eat me."</p>

<p>"No Mussulman would eat you, Buff Egret,"
said Gidar the Jackal. "It's because of your habit
of picking ticks off the Pigs."</p>

<p>"Some Birds do have vile habits," declared
Crow. "Paddy Bird has a Brother in Burma who
gets drunk on the Men's toddy."</p>

<p>"I doubt if that be true," said Sa'-zada, "though
he is really called 'Bacchus' in the science books."</p>

<p>Said Myna, "Of all Birds, I think the Jungle
Fowl are the worst. The Cocks do nothing but
fight, fight, all the time&mdash;fight, and then get up in
a tree and crow about it, as though it were to their
credit."</p>

<p>Said Kauwa the Crow, "When one of our family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
becomes quarrelsome, or a great nuisance, we hold
a meeting&mdash;I have seen even a thousand Crows at
such meetings&mdash;hear all there is to say about him,
and then if it appears that he is utterly bad we beat
him to death."</p>

<p>"Tub-full-of-bread!" exclaimed Hathi, sleepily,
"it's my opinion that all Birds should be on their
roosts&mdash;it's very late."</p>

<p>"And roost high, too," said Magh, "for Coyote
and Gidar have been licking their chops for
the last hour. I've watched them. And lock
Python up, O Sa'-zada, for high roosts won't save
them from him."</p>

<p>"All to bed, all to bed!" cried the Keeper. "To-morrow
night we'll have some more tales."</p>

<p>The last cry heard on the sleepy night air after
all were safely in their cages was Cockatoo's "Avast
there, you lubber!" as Myna, sticking his saucy
yellow beak through the bars of his cage, called
across to him, "Want a glass of grog, Polly?"</p>

<h2><a name="EIGHTH_NIGHT" id="EIGHTH_NIGHT"></a><big>EIGHTH NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORIES OF BUFFALO AND BISON</h2>


<p>This evening the whole Buffalo herd had
come out of the park to the meeting-place
in front of Chita's cage; even their brother, the
Indian Bison, was there, as also was the true Buffalo,
Bos Bubalus.</p>

<p>Said Sa'-zada, opening his book: "We should
learn much this evening, for Buffalo and Bison are
to tell us of their lives. But first, let me put you
all right as to their names. Those we have called
Buffalo, from our own western prairies, are not
Buffalo at all, but Bison, half-brother of Gaur, who
also lives in India, where the true Buffalo comes
from."</p>

<p>"It does not matter," said Buff, the prairie
Bison, "it does not matter what I'm called, seems
to me, for all my life I have been most badly
treated. Why, it seems no time since I was a calf,
one of a mighty herd, on the sweet-grassed prairie,
and in those days I thought there was nothing in
the world like being a Buffalo.</p>

<p>"The first touch of danger I remember came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
this way. The herd had tracked, one after another,
all walking in the same narrow path, down to
a hollow in which was water. I was feeling frisky,
and, seeing something move, something that
seemed very like a calf, smaller than myself, I ran
after it, cocking my tail, kicking my heels in the
air, and thinking it great sport; for, Comrades, the
great weakness of all grass-feeders is an idle curiosity."</p>

<p>"And did all this happen when you had your
tail kinked in the air, that time you were a
silly calf?" jibed Magh, holding a peanut out
on her under lip, and looking down at it very
sedately, as though the subject were of little
interest.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you my story in my own way," declared
Buff. "The thing that I followed was like a grey
shadow, and slipped about with no noise, but when
I came close to it, with a vicious snarl it sprang up,
and also there were three others hidden in the
grass. Much milk! but I became afraid, and I believe
I bawled. Just then I felt the ground tremble,
and a dozen of the herd galloped towards
me with their heads down. It was a wolf, and
help came just in time, for the big fangs of the
fierce brute cut my hind leg a little where he sought
to hamstring me.</p>

<p>"Then Mother explained, first bunting me
soundly with her forehead, then licking me with
her coarse tongue, that these Wolves were always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
following up the Herd, trying to catch a Calf, or
sick Cow, or old Bull, to one side."</p>

<p>"We have Wolves in India, too," said Arna,
"and Chita the Leopard, and Bagh the Tiger.
Blood drinkers! but we have many enemies there;
even Cobra will hardly get out of the way seeking
to carry to one's blood his sudden death. There
are no animals so ill used, I believe, as Buffalo.</p>

<p>"One has need of big Horns in the heart of the
Jungle. Why, mine measure nine feet and a half
from tip to tip across my forehead. And see the
strength of them, fully the size of Bagh's leg&mdash;for
I am a Curly Horn, which means one of great
strength. Never have I locked Horns with a Bull
that I have not twisted his neck till he bellowed.
Eugh-hu, eugh! Next to lying in muddy water
with one's nose just peeping out, there's nothing so
pleasant as a trial of strength. And with all respect
to Hathi's handiness of trunk, I must say I
prefer good, stout Horns. When Bagh or Pardus
come sneaking about, there's nothing like a long
reach.</p>

<p>"Hear that, friends," said Magh. "Here's a
traveler from Panther's own land calls him a sneak.
He, he he! now we shall get at the truth."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gaur, the Bison; "Panther and all
his tribe are sneaks. They murdered a Calf of
mine. To be sure, it was the Wife's Calf, for
had I been there at the time I'd have fixed him.
She had just lain down to rest for the night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and the Calf was a little to one side, and this evil-spotted
thing, Panther of the Red Kind, came
sneaking up the wind like a proper Jungle Cat.
He knew I was away, for he has the cunning of
Cobra, and how was the mother to know that any
danger threatened? He stole like a shadow close
to the poor little Calf, and with a rush jumped on
his back and bit his neck, breaking it, and cutting
it so the red blood ran his life all out in a little
while."</p>

<p>"I was born in Mardian," remarked Arna, the
Buffalo, "many years ago; and save for the loss of a
Calf, through Chita or Bagh's treachery, or perhaps
a lone Cow at times, our herd feared no Dweller of
the Jungles. Mine is a big family," he ruminated,
"for we wander over almost all India and Burma.
Before I had grown up our Bull leader had taught
us all the method of battle. When it was Bagh,
we formed up, heads out, with the Calves behind,
and if we but saw him in time, he surely was slain,
if he sought strongly for a Kill.</p>

<p>"I learned all the different sounds that come far
ahead of danger. One's ears get wondrous sharp
in the Jungle, I can tell you, where the little Gonds
hunt. If a stone went singing down the hillside,
that meant Men, and Men meant the worst kind
of danger. No Animal starts a stone rolling; we
are too careful for that.</p>

<p>"Also do the Jungle Dwellers not break sticks
as they travel. The crack of a broken twig meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Men Hunters; and when a beat was on, the Jungle
was, indeed, possessed of great sounds. All the
Dwellers ran mad with fear&mdash;the fear-madness
that is like unto the way of Baola Kutta, the Mad
Dog. There is nothing so terrible in the life of an
Animal as the drive of the Hunters. 'Tap, tap,
tap,' like the knocking of Horns together, meant
the strike of Beaters against the trees, and then
the Men's voices crying, '<i>Aree ho teri</i>.'</p>

<p>"I, who tremble not at the roar of a Tiger, shivered
when I heard that, and lost all knowledge of
which way I should run&mdash;that was in the first drive,
of course, before I became possessed of much
Jungle wisdom. Surely it drove us all mad. Like
the sound of rain falling on leaves was the rush of
Python's little feet as even he flew from the Man-danger.</p>

<p>"Our best food was down in the <i>jhils</i>, also the
nice soft mud to lie in, and in the early spring, after
the fires had passed, the young bamboo shot up and
we ate them. Then when we took it into our heads,
we went up into the deep, cool sal forest and rested
in peace. But in the Dry Time was the time of
danger, for we had to travel far to find water. We
are not like Antelope or Nilgai, who go without
water for days and days.</p>

<p>"I remember once when we had crept down out
of the hills, leaving the big sal trees behind, and
passing through tamarind, and mango, and pipal,
and just as we were coming to the pool, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
almost hidden in the jamin bushes, I heard a roar&mdash;there
was a rush and a Bagh of ferocious
strength sprang on one of our Cows and sought to
break her neck.</p>

<p>"But worse than Bagh's cruel charge was the
silent method of the little, dark Men-kind&mdash;the
Mariahs. Like Magh's people, they would sit
quiet in the trees, and as we came slowly back from
the water would shoot arrows into us. Of this we
could have no warning, neither any chance to fight
for our lives, only the noise of the arrow coming
like the hiss of King Cobra, and the cruel sting of
its sharp end. Our Bull leader got one this way
not strong enough to bring him to his death, and
for days and days it stayed in his side, and made
him of such a vile temper that the Herd had to
cast him forth, and he became what is known as a
Solitary Bull.</p>

<p>"There is some kindness in Bagh's method, more
than in the way of these evil Men, for when he
kills he kills, and there is no more sickness; but of
the Men, when they hunt us with their arrows or a
thunder-stick which strikes with a loud noise, many
of our kind are struck and die at the end of much
time.</p>

<p>"Strong as the fire-stick is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Arna means by the fire-stick a gun," explained
Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Strong as it is," continued Arna, "we Buffalo
are also of great strength. Why, the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
on my neck and withers would stop its strike any
time."</p>

<p>"Stop the Bullet?" queried Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Yes," asserted the Bull. "I have at least three
buried in the thick skin of my neck, and I hardly
know they are there. Why, it has been known in
my Herd for a Bull to be struck fifteen times by
one of these fire-sticks, and then the Men did not
get him. But just behind the shoulders we are
weak. My mother taught me a trick of this sort&mdash;'Never
stand sideways to an enemy,' she told me.
Yes, though it is good to be of great strength, a
little wisdom is also of much use, even to a Buffalo."</p>

<p>"It was so with us," concurred Prairie Bison.
"From all the other animals we suffered little compared
with the misery that came from the Men&mdash;the
Redmen; and worse still were the Palefaces;
it was, as you say, Brother, all because of the fire-stick."</p>

<p>"Even I was struck by it," continued Arna; "it
was this way. Early one morning I had gone down
to a <i>jhil</i>, being alone at that time of the year, for
our wives were busy with the Calves, and, as I was
going to the uplands, to a favorite <i>nulla</i> of mine,
in which to rest, suddenly I caught sight of an
evil-faced Gond; these same Gonds being of all
Shikaris (hunters) the most strong in their thirst
for blood. I rushed away for the hills, thinking to
leave him behind. I traveled far, and thought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
myself, now surely I have lost this small killer.
Being hungry, I fed on the rich grass, but, as I fed,
suddenly a dry twig broke in the Jungle, and I
knew that it was either Hathi or the little Gond.
Looking back, I saw with the Shikari another of a
white face. Again I galloped, and trotted, and
walked, up a long <i>nulla</i>, over a hill, around by the
side of it, turned, and went far back, much the
way I had come, only to one side. Then I sought
the top of a hill where the bamboos grew thick,
thinking to hide. As I rested, an evil smell, that
was not of the Jungle, came to me as the wind
turned in its course and blew up the hill. I stood
perfectly still, even ceased to flap my ears against
the wicked Flies. As I watched, suddenly this Man
of the white face stood up from the grass just the
shortest of gallops away, his thunder-stick roared,
and something I could not see struck me most
viciously in the shoulder. I was mad. Lashing
my hips with my tail, and throwing my nose
straight out, I charged him.</p>

<p>"Again his thunder-stick spoke loud, but there
was no sting&mdash;nothing, and he turned from me
and ran down the hill. Just as I was almost upon
him, he looked back, his foot caught in a bush and
he fell. Now, as I have said, my big Horns are of
great use when Bagh charges, or when another
Bull disputes the right to command the Herd, but
as for the small enemy lying on the ground, I could
not get at him at all; besides, I was rushing down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
hill at great speed, so, though I lowered my head
till my forehead almost crushed him into the earth,
yet I had him not on the Horns, as, carried by my
weight, I was forced to the very bottom. Before
I could turn he was up and away, and I never saw
him again."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;SOMETHING I COULD NOT SEE STRUCK ME MOST VICIOUSLY IN THE SHOULDER.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"We are also killed by the Men," added Muskwa,
the Bear. "They take off our black coats, and
I thought, perhaps, that was lest we might come to
life again. Yes, I think they mean to kill all Animals."</p>

<p>"They have killed nearly all my people," sighed
Prairie Cow&mdash;"nearly all of them. I know that is
true, for one day Sa'-zada came into our corral,
and, rubbing his nice soft hand on my forehead&mdash;I
was sick that day, I remember&mdash;said, 'Poor old
girl! we must take care of you, for there are not
many of your sort left now.' Then he said it was a
shame that the brutes had slaughtered us so."</p>

<p>"Ghurr-ah!" barked Wolf, "tell of this thing,
O Buffalo Cow, for to me it has been much of a
mystery where the many of your kind could have
gone."</p>

<p>"Lu-ah!" sighed Prairie Cow, "it makes me sad
to even think of it. As I have said, in my young
life we were many, many in numbers like you have
seen our enemies, the Men, here at times. All
through the long, warm days of sun, we ate the
grass that grew again as fast as we cropped it.
Our humps became big and full of rich fat for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
cold time. Not that I had the hump on my back
as a Calf, not needing it as food, for my mother's
milk kept my stomach at peace when the winds
were cold, and the grass perhaps under a white
cover. Sometimes when the days were harsh we
had to travel far in search of feed grass, but that
was nothing: few of us died because of this. Even
when the Red-faced ones sought us, they killed
but few, for their hunger was soon stayed. But
suddenly there came to us a time of much fear.
Wherever we went we were chased by the Palefaces,
and their fire-sticks were forever driving
the fire that kills into our faces. Our Bull leader
was always taking us farther and farther away,
and our Herd was getting smaller and smaller.
It was a miserable life, for there was never any
rest.</p>

<p>"At last our Bull said that we must go on a long
trail, for the prairie wind was talking of nothing
but danger; so we trailed far to the south. For
days and days we passed across hot sand deserts in
which there was little grass and hardly any drinking.
It was terrible. My hump melted to nothing;
we were all like that, worse than we had ever
been after the coldest time of little sun.</p>

<p>"Then we came to a land in which there was
grass and water, and none of the Men-kind; and
once more we were content, only for thinking of
our friends that had been killed. I don't remember
how long we were there&mdash;I think I had raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
two Calves, when one day the evil that comes of
the Men was once more with us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is even as I have said," interrupted
Arna; "when one thinks he has got away safely,
and stops for a little rest, he will see that evil Gond,
or some other of the Men-kind, waiting to do him
harm."</p>

<p>"Just so," commented Prairie Cow; "the Palefaces
had found us out. But I must say there was
less use of the fire-sticks than before, and I soon
came to know why they had trailed us across the
Texas desert&mdash;they had come to steal our Calves.
Never were any poor Animals so troubled by
Man's evil ways as were we Buffalo. At first I
thought they had not fire-sticks with them, and
meant to kill and eat the Calves, they being less
able to fight. I remember the very day my Calf
was taken. As the Herd fed in a little valley, we
saw three Wild Horses coming toward us&mdash;we
thought they were Wild Horses, but it was an evil
trick of the Palefaces, for beside each Horse
walked one of the Men. They were down wind
from us, so we did not discover this. Suddenly
our Herd leader&mdash;he was a great Bull, too&mdash;gave
a grunt of warning&mdash;much like Bear grunts, only
louder; but still we could see nothing to put fear
into our hearts. Then our leader commenced to
throw sand up against his sides with his forefeet,
and, lowering his head, shook it savagely.
'Why does he wish to battle?' I wondered, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the Wild Horses had never made trouble for my
people.</p>

<p>"Just then the Men jumped on their animals,
and away we raced. I remember as I ran wondering
why there was no loud bark of the fire-stick, for
I could see the Hunters galloping fast after us; in
fact one of them was close at my heels, for my
youngest Calf, not two months old, could not run
as swiftly as I wished. I was keeping him close;
and on my other side galloped my Calf that was a
year old.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I heard a 'swisp' in the air, and my
little curly-haired pet gave a choking gasp and fell
in the grass. Of course, I could not stop at once,
and he bawled much as I did when the Wolf was
at my hock. When I turned in great haste I saw
the Paleface on top of him. I was just crazy with
rage. I charged full at the Man and his Horse,
and it almost makes me laugh now to think how
I kept him jumping about. He did use a small firestick
on me, but I am sure it was because of the
Man-fear, of which Hathi told us; I saw it in his
eyes plain enough. But who can stand against the
fire-stick? Not even Bagh or Hathi, as we know,
so I was forced to flee with the Herd.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;SUDDENLY I HEARD A &#39;SWISP&#39; IN THE AIR, AND MY LITTLE CURLY-HAIRED
PET&nbsp;...&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"We galloped far, far, before we stopped; and
that night there were many mothers in the Herd
bawling and crying for their lost Calves, for these
evil Men had stolen a great number. I felt so sad
thinking of my little one's trouble that I could stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
it no longer, so I went back on our trail, and, following
up the scene of the Men-kind, came to
where they had my Calf and the others. It was
night. I soon found him, for a Cow Mother's nose
is most wise when looking for her young. But I
could not get him away with me, for he was held
fast by something; so I stayed there and let him
drink of my milk.</p>

<p>"Even with the fear of a fire-stick on me I
stayed with him, and in the morning when the Pale-faces
saw me their eyes were full of much wonder.
But I did not try to run away, and one of them,
making many motions and noises to the other two,
I think, commanded them not to harm me. Well,
good Comrades," sighed the Cow, regretfully,
"mine has been a very long story, I'm afraid, but
when one talks of her Babe there is so much to be
said."</p>

<p>"And did they bring you here with the Calf?"
asked Magh.</p>

<p>"Most surely," answered Prairie Cow; "and because
of my milk he grew big and strong, much
faster than grew the other Calves, and is now big
Bull of the Herd."</p>

<p>"But how fared the others with no mothers?"
asked Chita.</p>

<p>"They gave them Cow mothers of the tame
kind," answered the Cow.</p>

<p>Said Arna, scratching his back with the point
of his long horn: "It is not quite this way with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
us in India. We stick pretty well to the <i>jhils</i> and
Jungles, so the Men cannot kill many of us at one
time; but still we are becoming fewer. Even those
of the black kind now have the thunder-stick, and
kill my comrades to sell their heads to the horn
merchants. Think of that, Brothers, having a
price on one's head, like a Bhil robber."</p>

<p>Said Sa'-zada: "I wish all the Men who slay
Animals, calling it sport, might have sat here to-night
with us, that their hearts might be inclined
more kindly toward you, Brothers, who war not
against my kind."</p>

<p>"Sa'-zada," cried Hathi, in a gentle voice, "could
you not put all these things in a new book, and lend
it to each one of your people so that they might
know of these true things? Surely then they would
not seek for the life of each one of us that has
done them no harm."</p>

<p>"I have a notion to try it, good Comrade," said
the Keeper. "But in the meantime it is late, and
now you must all go back to your corrals and
cages."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Prairie Cow," trumpeted Hathi,
softly, caressing her forehead with his trunk; "your
people most certainly have been badly treated by
the Men."</p>

<p>Soon silence reigned over the home of these outcasts
from the different quarters of the world.</p>

<h2><a name="NINTH_NIGHT" id="NINTH_NIGHT"></a><big>NINTH NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORY OF UNT, THE CAMEL</h2>


<p>The clink of a loose chain; the complaining
wail of a swinging iron door; the squeak
of a key turning an unwilling lock&mdash;a heavy-bolted
lock; a flutter of wings; the crunch of giant feet on
the echoing gravel; huge forms slipping through
the moonlight, like prehistoric monsters; a slim,
ribbon-like body gliding noiselessly over the grass
cushion of the Park's sward; muffled laughter, bird
calls and a remonstrative grunt from Wild Boar;
the merry chatter of Magh the Orang; a guarded
"Phrut-t-t, Phrut-t-t" from Hathi, the huge Elephant&mdash;ah,
yes, all these; surely it was the gathering
of old friends, who, like the listeners of the
Arabian Night's tales, had for many evenings
talked of their Jungle life in front of Black Panther's
cage.</p>

<p>"You are all welcome," growled Pardus.</p>

<p>Magh hopped on the end of Hathi's trunk, and
the latter lifted her gracefully to a seat on his broad
forehead. She had Blitz, the Fox Terrier, with
her. "You will hear some lies to-night, Pup," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
confided to him. "But who is to talk?" she asked
suddenly; "Chee-he! Sa'-zada, our good Keeper,
who's to talk?"</p>

<p>"Camel is to tell us of his life," answered the
Keeper.</p>

<p>"That stupid creature, who is too lazy to brace
up and look spry, talk to us? Next we know we'll
have a tale from Turtle."</p>

<p>"That's it," sneered Boar, "if one is honest and
a plodder like Unt, bandy-legged creatures like
Magh will call him stupid."</p>

<p>Unt, with a bubbling grunt, knelt down, doubled
his hind legs under him like a jack-knife, made himself
comfortable, and commenced his personal history.</p>

<p>"Bul-lul-luh!" he muttered. "I was born in
Baluchistan, on the nice white sand plains of the
Sibi <i>Put</i> (desert). As Mooswa has said, there
must be some great Animal who arranges things
for us. Think of it, Comrades, I had the good fortune
to be born in just the loveliest spot any animal
could wish for. As far as I could see on every side
was the hot, dry sand of the beautiful Sibi desert."</p>

<p>"I know," interrupted Ostrich; "my home in
Arabia was like that. I've listened to Arna here,
and Bagh, telling of the thick Jungles where one
could scarce see three lengths of his own body, and
I must say that I think it very bad taste."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was lovely there," bubbled Unt. "No
wonder that Bagh, when he was chased by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Beaters, fled to the sand <i>damar</i> and hid in the
korinda thorns. Such sweet eating they are, firm
under one's teeth. The green food is dreadful
stuff. Once crossing the Sibi <i>Put</i>, when I was three
days without food, I remember coming to Jacobabad,
a place where the foolish ones of the Men-kind
had planted trees, and bushes, and grass, and
kept them green with water. I ate of these three
green things, and nearly died from a swelling in my
stomach.</p>

<p>"Well, as I have said, I was born in that nice
sand place, and for three or four years did nothing
but follow mother Unt about. Then they put a
button in my nose, and tied me with a cord to the
tail of another Unt, and put merchandise on my
back for me to carry. There was a long line of
us, and in front walked Dera Khan, the Master.
We seemed to be always working, always carrying
something; our only rest was when we were being
loaded or unloaded. We were made to lie down
when the packs were put on our backs, and many
a time I have got up suddenly when the boxes were
nearly all on, rose up first from behind, you know,
and sent the things flying over my head. I would
get a longer rest that way, but also I got much
abuse, though I didn't mind it, to be sure; for, as
Mooswa has said, our way of life is all arranged
for us, and the abuse that was thrust upon me was
a part of my way.</p>

<p>"But one year there came to Sibi many Men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the war-kind, and with them were the black ones
from Bengal. It was a fat one of this kind, one of
little knowledge of the ways of an Unt, a 'Baboo,'
Dera Khan called him, who caused me much
misery. It was my lot to take him and his goods
to the Bolan Pass, so Dera said, for the One-in-Charge,
a Sahib, had so ordered it. When I sought
to rise, as usual, when the load was but half in
place, he got angry and beat me with a big-leafed
stick he carried to keep the heat from his head.
But in the end I brought to his knowledge the
method of an Unt who has been beaten without
cause.</p>

<p>"When all his pots and pans, and boxes of books,
wherein was writing, had been bound to my saddle,
the Baboo clambered on top. I must say that I
could understand little of his speech, for my Master,
Dera Khan, was a Man of not many words, but
the Baboo was as full of talk as even Magh is;
and of very much the same intent, too&mdash;of little
value."</p>

<p>"Big lip! Crooked neck! Frightener of
Young!" screamed Magh, hurling the epithets at
Camel with vindictive fury.</p>

<p>"Unt's tale is truly a most interesting one; there
is much wit in his long head," commented Pardus.
Camel rolled the cud in his mouth three or four
times, dropped his heavy eyelids reflectively, bubbled
a sigh of meek resignation and proceeded:</p>

<p>"When I rose from behind, the Baboo nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
fell over my neck; when I came sharply to my forefeet
(for I was always a very spry, active Unt),
he declared to Dera Khan that I had broken his
back. But I knew this couldn't be true, for I was
always a most unlucky Unt. Of course, this time
I was not tied to the tail of a mate, but my leading
line was with the Baboo. He shouted 'Jao' to me,
and in addition called me the Son of an Evil Pig.</p>

<p>"Have any of you ever seen one of my kind run
away?" Camel asked, swinging his big head inquiringly
about the circle.</p>

<p>"I have," answered Black Panther. "Once, being
hungry, I crept close to an Unt to ask him if he
could tell me where I might find a Chinkara or
other Jungle Dweller for my dinner. I saw <i>that</i>
Camel run. For a small part of the journey I was
on his back; but though I can cling to anything
pretty well, yet the twists of his long legs were too
much for me, and I landed on my head in the sand,
nearly breaking my back."</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Camel, "you will understand
how the Baboo and his pots and pans fared when
I ran away with him, which I did as soon as Dera
Khan moved a little to one side. At first I couldn't
get well into my stride, for the Baboo pulled at the
nose rope, and called to Dera in great fear. Dera
also ran beside me, holding to the ropes that were
on the boxes; many things fell, coming away like
cocoanuts from a tree. An iron pot going down
with much speed struck my Master on his head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
he said the same fierce words that he always used
when I caused him trouble of any kind.</p>

<p>"You know, though I ran fast, yet by tipping my
head a little to one side I could see what was doing
behind, and I saw a basket in which were many
round, white things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eggs," suggested Cockatoo. "Those were the
round white things Potai brought from bazaar in
a basket."</p>

<p>"Yes, they were in a basket," repeated Camel,
solemnly; "so, as you say, Cocky, I suppose they
were eggs; but, however, they came down all at
once on the face and shoulders of my loved Master."</p>

<p>"And broke, Cah-cah-cah!" laughed Kauwa the
Crow; "I know. More than once I've seen relatives
of mine have their eggs broken through being
thrown out of the nest by Cuckoo Bird."</p>

<p>"As I have said," continued Camel, "my Master
was a Man of few words, but at this he let go
of the rope, and the language he used still rings in
my ears. Dry chewing! how I fled. And behind
chased Dera Khan, a big knife in his hand&mdash;in
spite of his violence I had to laugh at the color the
eggs had left on his long beard&mdash;a knife in his
hand, and crying aloud that he would cut the Baboo's
throat.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;I REMAINED IN THE JHIL UNTIL MY MASTER HAD LOST THE FIERCE KILL-LOOK.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"As I swung first one side of my legs, and then
the other over the sweet sand desert, I could feel
the Baboo thumping up and down on my back, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
he was clinging to the saddle with both hands.
Sometimes he abused me, and sometimes he begged
me to stop; that I was a good Unt&mdash;his Father
and Mother, and his greatest friend. As he would
not be shaken off because of his fear of Dera
Khan's knife, I carried him into a <i>jhil</i> of much
water; there he was forced to let go, and when he
got to the bank, if it had not been for a Sahib he
would most surely have been killed by my Master.
Hathi has told us of the fear-look he has seen in
the faces of the Men-kind, and there was much of
this in the eyes of that Baboo. I remained in the
<i>jhil</i> until my Master had lost the fierce kill-look,
then I came out, and save for some of the old
abuse there was nothing done to me.</p>

<p>"But we all went to the Bolan Pass, carrying
food for those that labored there making a path
for the Fire Caravan, the bearer of burdens that is
neither Bullock, nor Unt, nor aught that I know
of."</p>

<p>"It was a railroad," Sa'-zada, the Keeper, explained.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," grunted Unt, licking his pendulous
upper lip; "perhaps, but we Unts spoke of it as the
Fire Caravan. Still it was an evil thing, a destroyer
of lives, many lives, for never in that whole
land of sand-hills and desert was there so much
heat and so much death.</p>

<p>"First the <i>Bail</i> (Bullocks) died as though Bagh
the Killer had taken each one by the throat; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
those of my kind fell down by the fire-path and
could not rise again. And the air, that is always
so sweet on the hot sand plains, became like the
evil breath of the place wherein nests Boar."</p>

<p>"Ugh, ugh!" grunted Wild Boar, "even there,
by this stupid tale of Unt's, there was something
evil to be likened to my kind."</p>

<p>"The water that had been sweet ran full of a
sickness because of all this, and the Men that drank
of it were stricken with the Black Death. At first
it was those of the Black-kind, and then the others,
the Sahibs, became possessed of it. And then the
Burra-Sahib, Huzoor the Governor, was taken with
it; so said one of the Sahibs who came to Dera
Khan just as he was tying a rope about my foreleg
so that I could not rise and wander in the night.</p>

<p>"'It is sixty miles to Sibi,' this Sahib, who was
but young, said to my Master.</p>

<p>"'By the Grace of Allah, it is more,' Dera answered
him.</p>

<p>"'The Big Sahib, who is my friend, is stricken
with the Black Death,' said the young Sahib, 'and
also the Baboo Doctor is the same, being close to
his death; and unless I get a Healer from Sibi to-morrow,
the Sahib who is my friend will surely
die.'</p>

<p>"'If Allah wills it so, Kismet,' answered my
Master.</p>

<p>"'Have you a fast Camel?' asked the young
Sahib.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"'This is Moti,' replied my Master, putting
his hand on my hump, 'and when he paces, the wind
remains behind.'</p>

<p>"Then the young Sahib promised my Master
many rupees and much work for the other Unts,
so be it he might ride me to Sibi for a Doctor.</p>

<p>"By a meal of brown paper such as one picks up
in a bazaar, I swear that I understood more of
what that meant to my Master than many a Camel
would have known, for had I not seen it all, this
that I am about to tell? You know, Comrades,
that the Burra-Sahib was a Man of a dry temper,
and it so happened that one day Dera Khan had
displeased him, which I just say was a way my
Master had often. That was a full moon before
the coming of the Black Sickness. Oh, Friends,
but I had seen it all; it made me tremble, knowing
of the readiness with which Dera Khan argued
with his knife, like unto the manner of Pathans.</p>

<p>"The Big Sahib would have struck my Master
but for this same young Sahib who had now come
with his offer of many rupees&mdash;this Sahib who had
been there at that time. So, Comrades, there was
<i>good</i> hate for the sick man in Dera's heart.</p>

<p>"'Will you send the Camel?' said the young
Sahib; and Dera, drawing himself up straight, even
as I do under a heavy load, held out his hand and
said, 'Allah! thou art a Man. My goods are your
goods, but for the other, the one who is your friend
and my enemy, the wrath of Allah upon him.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Sahib was on my back in a little.</p>

<p>"I have said before that with the Baboo and
many kettles on my back I ran fast, but think
you, Comrades, of the weight, and also of the poor
rider, for there is nothing an Unt dislikes so much
as the knock, knock, against his hump of one having
no knowledge of proper pace. How the Sahib sat!
Close as a pad that had been tied on; and he coaxed
and urged&mdash;even swore a little at times, but not
after an unreasoning manner as had the Baboo.
He called me a Bikaneer, even his Dromedary,
which means one of great speed; and begged me,
if I wished food for all time, to hasten. How we
fled in the long night, down the hot paths, splashing
many times through the cool water that crossed
our path&mdash;Bolan River, it is called, the water that
comes from the high-reaching sand lands that are
all white on their tops."</p>

<p>"The snow mountains," explained Sa'-zada, for
Camel's description was more or less vague.</p>

<p>"As I have said," continued Camel, "the water
was cool. Never once did I fall, though the round
stones were like evil things that twist at one's feet
to bring him down. 'Hurry, hurry, hurry!' the
young Sahib called to me, and I laughed, thinking
he would tire before I should.</p>

<p>"On we went, passing little fires where those of
the Cooly kind rested as they fled from the Black
Death. Just as we came out on the flat sand which
is the Sibi Desert, there were gathered in one place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
many Men. For a space we stopped, and
my Rider asked if there was a Healer with
them. They answered that they were Men of the
war-kind going up to keep the workers from
running away from the Black Death; even
those at the little fires would be turned back, they
said.</p>

<p>"Then on again I raced. I could hear my Rider
talking back to his friend, the Burra-Sahib, who
lay stricken with the evil sickness, though I know
not how he could hear him, for we were full half
way to Sibi.</p>

<p>"'Keep up your courage, Jack,' he would say,
speaking to his Friend. 'Please God, I'll have a
Surgeon there in time to save you yet.'</p>

<p>"Then he would fall to abusing some other of
the Men-kind, perhaps he was not a friend, whom
he blamed for all that was wrong. 'You puffed-up
beast,' he would say, speaking to this other, 'to
send a lot of Men to such a death hole with a brute
of a Bengali-Baboo to doctor them&mdash;murder them,
and a medicine chest that was emptied in a day.
It's a bit of luck that Baboo died, but it doesn't
help matters much.'</p>

<p>"That was the Baboo I had run away with; perhaps
even the medicine chest had lost much through
its fall from my back.</p>

<p>"Then to me, 'Hurry, hurry, hurry! Shabaz!'
(push on); then to his Friend, 'Poor old Man,
Jack! what will <i>She</i> say if I don't pull you out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
this? I'll never go back to England as long as I
live if this beastly thing snuffs you out.'</p>

<p>"Then to the other, the one who had done this
evil: 'Curse you, with your red tape economy!
You're a C. I. E.'&mdash;whatever that meant I don't
know&mdash;'but you've murdered old Jack, who is a
Man. You're out of this trouble up at Simla, but
you'll roast for this yet.'</p>

<p>"You know, Comrades," said Unt, plaintively,
"I didn't know all about this thing&mdash;I couldn't understand
it, you see, being an Unt, and, as Magh
says, stupid; but someway I felt like doing my best
for the young Sahib who did not make me cross by
beating me, but only cried 'Hurry! Shabaz! my
swift runner,' and shook a little at the nose line in
his haste."</p>

<p>"I have often felt that way," encouraged Hathi;
"once I remember, it was in Rangoon, that time I
was working in the timber yards. I had a Mahout
who never stuck the sharp iron goad in my head at
all. He always told me everything I was to do by
different little knocks on my ears with his knees
as he sat on my neck. And also by soft speech, of
course, for, as you say, Unt, it keeps one from getting
cross, or filled with fear, and so one has only
to think of what the Master requires. You were
right to run fast with such a rider."</p>

<p>"This is Camel's story," pleaded Sa'-zada.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;BUT SOME WAY I FELT LIKE DOING MY BEST.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Never mind," bubbled Unt; "I was just trying
to remember what time we got to Sibi&mdash;I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
it was before the sands grew hot from the sun.
Straight to the <i>Teshil</i> (Government office) the
young Sahib rode me. Here he made an orderly
bring me food and drink while he went quick to
bring a Healer for his Friend. I had scarce time to
store half the <i>raji</i> away for future cud-chewing,
when back he came with a Healer of the White
Kind.</p>

<p>"Now, the <i>Teshildar</i>, who was Chief of Sibi, was
a slow-motioned Man, not given to hurry; that was
because the hump on his stomach was large with
the fat of great eating; and when the Sahib asked
for another Unt to carry the Healer, this Man who
was Chief made no haste&mdash;not at first; but when
the young Sahib, no doubt thinking of his friend
Jack, threatened him with the wrath of the Governor,
also the smaller anger of his own fists, the
<i>Teshildar</i> had an Unt of great speed quickly
brought forth. Then the young Sahib, speaking to
me, said, 'My heavy-eyed Friend, also one of much
strength, can you go straight back the sixty miles?'</p>

<p>"Of course, at that time I couldn't speak in his
words, though I could understand, so I just shook
myself, and stretched out my long hind legs, as
much as to say, 'Mount to my back, and I will try.'</p>

<p>"We started, the Healer on the other Unt, and
the Sahib on my back. I shall never forget that
ride. Sore legs! but at first it was not easy to keep
up with my Comrade, who was fresh; but also was
he a trifle like the <i>Teshildar</i>, fat in the hump, so in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the end that had its effect, and I managed to keep
pace with him.</p>

<p>"We reached back in the Bolan just as the sun
was straight over our heads. By the <i>raji</i> that was
still in my gullet I was tired; so was the young
Sahib, for when I knelt down, and he slipped
quickly from my back, he spun round and round
like a box that has broken loose, and came to the
ground in haste. Just as he fell, Dera Khan
caught him, and lifted him up; then he and the
Healer went to the tent where was his friend Jack.
And I heard my Master, Dera, say afterward, that
the little Sahib never slept while it was twice dark
and twice light; that was until the Healer said the
stricken one, Jack, the Burra-Sahib, was again free
of the Black Death."</p>

<p>"I think it is a true tale," remarked Adjutant,
putting down his left leg and taking up his right.
"I have seen much of this Black Death in my forty
years of life, and the Men of the White-kind take
great care of each other. Now, those of the Black-kind
get the Man-fear which Hathi has spoken of,
in their eyes, and flee fast from this terrible sickness,
crying aloud that their livers have turned to
water. I, myself, though I am a bird of little
speech, could tell tales of both methods."</p>

<p>"But what became of you, Unt?" queried
Magh; "did you catch this sickness and die?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Camel, solemnly, not noticing the
sarcasm; "the little Sahib took me from Dera Khan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
by a present of silver, and kept me to ride on, and
in the end I was sent here to Sa'-zada."</p>

<p>"It's bed-time," broke in the Keeper; "let each
one go quickly to his cage or corral."</p>

<h2><a name="TENTH_NIGHT" id="TENTH_NIGHT"></a><big>TENTH NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORY OF BIG TUSK, THE WILD BOAR</h2>


<p>'Twas the tenth night of what might be
called the Sa'-zada convention, and Black
Panther was making the iron bars of his cage jingle
in their sockets with his full-voiced roar. Shoulders
spread, and head low to the floor, his white fangs
showing, he called "Waugh, waugh! Waw-houk!
Come, Comrades. Ganesh, One-tusked Lord of the
Jungles, Muskwa and Mooswa; you, Sher Abi,
eater of Water-men; even little Magh; come all of
you and listen to the lies of a Swine." Then he
laughed: "Che-hough, che-hough! the lying tales
of Jungli Soor."</p>

<p>"Ugh, ugh!" grunted Grey Boar, angrily, as
he slipped up the graveled walk to the front
of Leopard's cage. "In my land there is a
saying of the Men-kind, that 'A lie can hide
like a Panther; if it be a bad lie, that it is as
difficult to come face to face with as Black Panther.'"</p>

<p>By this time the animals had all gathered, and
Sa'-zada opening The Book, spoke:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is Wild Boar's night. I am sure he will
tell us something interesting."</p>

<p>"A lie is often amusing," declared Magh.</p>

<p>"That may be so," retorted Boar, "for even Sa'-zada
has said that you are the funniest Animal in
the Park."</p>

<p>"But why should we listen to Soor's squeaky
tales?" snarled Bagh; "when he gets excited his
voice puts me on edge."</p>

<p>"Well," interrupted Sa'-zada, "these meetings
are so that each animal may have a chance to tell
us what good there is in him."</p>

<p>"Then why should Soor waste our time?"
queried Magh. "Even he will know no good of
himself."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," answered Sa'-zada.
"I think every animal is for some good purpose,
and we can tell better after we have heard Boar's
story."</p>

<p>"Here are two of us, O Sa'-zada," said Grey
Boar. "I, who am from Burma, know of the way
of my kind in that land, and Big Tusk, who is also
here, being my Comrade, is from Nagpore, in
India, and can tell you how we are persecuted in
the North. If I am all bad, can anyone say why
it is? I am not an eater of Bhainsa, Men's Buffalo,
like Bagh and Pardus; neither am I, nor any of my
Kind, known as Man-killers. Even in Hathi's
family have there been Man-killers&mdash;the Rogue
Hathi."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it is said in the Jungles that you sometimes
kill <i>Bakri</i>, the Men's Sheep," declared Magh.</p>

<p>"All a lie!" answered Grey Boar. "We are
not animals of the Kill; neither do we wreck the
villages of the Men, as does Hathi, nor drive the
rice-growers from their lands&mdash;lest they be eaten&mdash;as
do Bagh and Pardus."</p>

<p>"But you eat their jowari and rice," asserted
Panther.</p>

<p>"A little of it at times, perhaps, but only a little.
Our food is of the Jungles, and how are we to know
just what has been grown by the Men, and what
has grown of itself? And in my land, which was
Aracan in Burma, but for me and my people the
Men could not live."</p>

<p>"In what manner, O Benefactor of the Oppressed?"
asked Magh, mockingly.</p>

<p>"Because of Python, and Cobra, and Karait, and
Deboia, and the other small Dealers of Death,"
answered Grey Boar, sturdily. "We roam the
Jungles, and when these Snakes, that are surely
evil, rise in our paths, we trample them, and tear
them with our tusks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And eat them, I know, cha-hau, cha-hau!"
laughed Hyena, smacking his watering lips.</p>

<p>"Yes," affirmed Grey Boar. "Are not we, alone,
of all Animals for this work? When Cobra strikes,
and fetches home, does not even Hathi, or Arna,
or mighty Raj Bagh, die quickly? But not so with
us. I can turn my cheek, thus, to King Cobra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
(and he held his big grizzled head sideways), and
when I feel the soft pat of his cold nose against my
fat jaw, I seize him by the neck, and in a minute
one of the worst enemies of Man is dead."</p>

<p>"What says King Cobra, then&mdash;Cobra and the
others&mdash;crawling destroyers?" asked Magh, maliciously.</p>

<p>"This is Boar's story," interrupted Mooswa, seeing
that Sa'-zada looked angry at the interruption.</p>

<p>"As I was saying," continued Grey Boar, "Cobra
and his cousins kill more of the Men-kind, many
times over, than all the other Jungle Dwellers put
together. Think of that, Comrades&mdash;even when
we are searching the Jungles on every side for these
evil Poisoners; so if it were not for us, what would
become of the Men? Yet in a hot time of little
Jungle food, if we but eat a small share from their
fields, the Men revile us. Also, there is cause for
fear at times in this labor that is ours. Once I remember
I had a tight squeeze&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Going through a fence into a jowari field, I
suppose," prompted Magh.</p>

<p>"I did not have my tail cut off for stealing cocoa-nuts,"
sneered Grey Boar. "The tight squeeze was
from Python; and do you know that to this day
I am half a head longer than I was before our slim
Friend twisted about my body. But I got his head
in my strong jaws just as I was near dead."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would not have managed it if he
had not squeezed you out long," said Pardus.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"What I say," continued Boar, "is, that we are
not the Evil Kind that is in the mouth of everyone.
Cobra crawls into the houses of the Men, and for
fear of their evil Gods they feed him; and one
day in anger he strikes to Kill. That is surely
wrong. But we live in houses of our own make."</p>

<p>"Certainly that is a lie," interrupted Magh.
"Thou art a wanderer in the Jungle, a dweller in
caves, even as Pard the Panther."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Little One," declared Hathi,
"for I have seen Boar's house. It's a sort of grass
hauda."</p>

<p>"Yes," affirmed Wild Boar; "it is all of my own
making, and of grass, to be sure. For days and
days at a time, I do nothing but cut the strong elephant
grass, and the big ferns, and the sweet bowlchie,
and pile it up into a house. Then I burrow
under it, and the rain beats it down over my back,
and soon I have a nice, clean, waterproof nest. I
am not a homeless vagabond like Magh and her
wandering tribe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that's just it," broke in Big Tusk, the
Nagpore Boar. "We, who are quiet and orderly
in our manner of life, living in houses of our own
building, as Grey Boar has said, are hunted and
killed by the White-faced ones as a matter of sport.
What think you of that, Sa'-zada&mdash;killed just for
our tusks&mdash;for a pair of teeth?"</p>

<p>"It is likewise so with me, my narrow-faced
Brother," whispered Hathi. "Many of my kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
are slain for their tusks; I, who have lived amongst
the Men, know that."</p>

<p>Continued Big Tusk: "Yes, this is so; I have
been in many a run in the corries of Nagpore. You
see, I learned the game from my Mother when I
was but a 'Squeaker,' for be it to the credit of the
White ones, they kill not the Sows with their sharp
spears."</p>

<p>"Was that pig-sticking?" asked Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"It was," declared Big Tusk; "and my Mother,
who was in charge of a Sounder of at least thirty
Pigs, knew all about this game. We'd be feeding
in the sweet bowlchie grass, or in a <i>thur khet</i>, when
suddenly I'd hear her say, 'Waugh! Ung-h-gh!'
which meant, 'Danger! lie low.' Then, watching,
we'd see those of the Black-kind here, and there,
and all over, with flags in their hands to drive the
Pigs certain ways, and to show the Sahibs which
way we went. Mother would always make us lie
still until the very last minute; but almost always,
sooner or later, the Sahibs would come galloping
on their horses right in amongst us. 'Ugh-ugh-ugh-ugh!'
Mother would call to us, and this meant,
'Run for it, but keep to cover'; and away we'd go,
from <i>sun khet</i> to <i>dol</i> field, and then into <i>shur</i> grass,
from Sirsee Bund to Hirdee Bund, or into the tall,
thick bowlchie. Now the trouble was this way:
Mother was so big and strong that the Sahibs on
their ponies always galloped after, thinking her a
Boar. Even the Black Men with the flags would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
cry, '<i>Hong! Hong! Burra dant wallah!</i>' which
means in their speech, 'A Boar of big tusks.'
Many a time I've heard Mother chuckle over the
run she'd given the Horsemen, for we'd lie up in
the grass, and listen to the White-faced ones, the
Sahibs, curse the Black Men most heartily for their
foolishness in calling Mother a big-tusked Boar.
It was all done to save the Tuskers, for while the
Sahibs were chasing Mother, many an old chap
has saved having a spear thrust through him by
clearing off to some other <i>bund</i>."</p>

<p>"You did have a good schooling," remarked
Gidar, the Jackal. "But did the Sahibs never spear
any of your young Brothers?"</p>

<p>"No; as I have said, it was only a big-tusked
one they cared for. But to me it seemed such a
cruel thing, even when I was young; killing us with
the sharp spears&mdash;for, more than once I've heard
the scream of a Boar as he was stabbed to death."</p>

<p>"But what were you doing in the <i>dol</i> grass, you
and your big Mother?" asked Bagh. "Were not
you eating the grain of the poor villagers? I remember
in my time, when I was a free Lord of the
Jungles, that a poor old <i>ryot</i> (farmer) had a little
field&mdash;a new field it was&mdash;just in the edge of the
Jungle. I also remember it was <i>raji</i> he grew in it,
and he prayed to me as though I were one of his
Hindoo Gods, asking me to keep close watch over
his field, and to kill all the Pigs, and the Chital,
and Black Buck that might come there to destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
his <i>raji</i>. Even, to give me a liking for the place,
that I might mark it down in my line of hunt, he
tied an old Cow there for my first Kill. I was the
making of that Man," declared Bagh, sitting down
and smoothing his big coarse mustache with his
velvet paw&mdash;"the making of him, for he had a
splendid crop of <i>raji</i>, and I, why I must have killed
a dozen Pigs in and about his field."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" cried Magh. "Sugared peanuts!
Every Jungle Dweller is growing into a
benefactor of the Men; even Pig is a much abused,
innocent chap; and here's Bagh a protector of the
poor <i>ryot</i>."</p>

<p>"But what were you doing in the <i>dol</i> field,
Grunter?" queried Cobra; "that's what Bagh
wants to know."</p>

<p>"Looking for Snakes," answered Boar, sulkily.
"But what if we did eat a trifle of the grain; was
that excuse for the Sahibs killing us? With their
Horses did they not beat down and destroy more
than we did? And have not the people of the land,
the Black-kind, taken more from us in the way of
food than we ever did from their fields? Many a
time have they been saved from starvation by the
meat of my tribe. And yet, through it all, we get
nothing but a bad name, and that just because we
stick up for our rights. Bagh talks about keeping
us from the Man's field; that is just like him&mdash;it
is either a false tale or he ate 'Squeakers'&mdash;little
Pigs that couldn't protect themselves. Would he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
tackle Me? Not a bit of it! If he did I'd soon
put different colored stripes on his jacket&mdash;red
stripes. He's a big, sneaking coward, that's what
Bagh is. Why, I've seen him sitting with his back
against a rock, afraid to move, while six Jungle
Dogs snapped at his very nose&mdash;waiting for him
to get up that they might fight him from all sides.
Ugh, ugh! a fine Lord of the Jungle! a sneak, to
eat little Pigs!</p>

<p>"But I did more than keep a <i>raji</i> field for a poor
villager; I saved his life, and from Bagh, too. I
don't know that he had ever given me to eat willingly,
or even made <i>pooja</i> to me, but I was coming
up out of his <i>thur</i> field one evening, and he was
fair in my path, with one of those foolish ringed
sticks in his hand. 'Ugh!' I said, meaning, 'Get
out of the way,' but he only stood there.</p>

<p>"This made me cross, and I thought he was disputing
the road with me, for I am not like Bagh,
the Lord of the Jungle, who slinks to one side.
Then I spoke again to the man, 'Ugh, ugh,
wungh!' meaning that I was about to charge. All
the time I was coming closer to him on the path.
Then I saw what it was; my friend, Stripes the
Tiger, was crouched just beyond the Man, lashing
the grass with his long, silly tail.</p>

<p>"Now as I had made up my mind to charge
something that was in my path, and as the sight
of Bagh in his evil temper drew my anger toward
him, I drove full at his yellow throat. Just one rip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of my tusks, and with a howl like a starved Jackal
he cleared for the Jungle. He meant to eat that
Man, you see."</p>

<p>"Now we are getting at the truth of the matter,"
cried Magh, gleefully. "When these Jungle
thieves fall out, we get to know them fairly well."</p>

<p>"But tell us more of this hunting of your kind
with the spears, O brother of the Big Tusks,"
pleaded Hathi. "It does seem an unjust thing."</p>

<p>"Well," continued the Seoni Boar, "as I have
said, while in my Mother's keeping, she taught
me much of the ways of the Boar Hunters. Many
a run from the Spear Men I've been in. But while
I was small, and had not tusks, of course I was
allowed to go, even when they came full upon the
top of us; but in a few years my tusks grew, and
each run became harder and more difficult to get
away from. Besides, early in the Cold Time, at
the time the Men call Christmas, we Boars all went
off by ourselves, and left the Sows and Squeakers
in peace; and, while I think of it, I've no doubt it
was at this time that Bagh killed so many of my
people in the <i>raji</i> fields. Had there been a big
Tusker or two there, Tiger would have been busy
looking for Chital or Sambhur.</p>

<p>"Well, through being away from my Mother
this way, and mixing with the other Boars, I got to
be quite capable of taking care of myself; and, as
I lived year after year, finally the Black Men, Ugh!
also the White-faced ones, gave to me the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
of the Seoni Boar. So, with the more knowledge
I gained with my years of being, the more I required
it, for the closer they hunted me.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT BAGH KILLED SO MANY OF MY PEOPLE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Strange how it is that every Jungle Dweller's
hand is against the Pig. I declare here, before all
you Comrades, that more than once I have been
lying dog-oh, close hid in the <i>bowlchie</i>, when a
screech-voiced Peacock has commenced to cry, 'Aih-ou,
aih-ou!' as plain as you like, 'Here he is, here
he is!' and down on my heels would come the Spear
Men on their rushing Ponies. But I soon learned
to take to the Scrub-Jungle, knowing that the ponies
would not follow me. But even there in the Jungle
I've been hunted by the Black-kind; and then it
was the same way, enemies afoot, and enemies overhead.
Langur, a fool-cousin of Magh's there,
many a time has betrayed my hiding-place to the
hunt Man. 'Che-che-che, wow, wow!' over my
head the silly thieves would chatter and well the
Huntsmen would know that I had gone that way.</p>

<p>"Once when I was started out of the Seoni Bund,
and was making with full speed through the <i>dol
khet</i>, a meddlesome white Dog came chasing after
me, snapping at my heels, and crying, 'Bah, ki-yi,
bah, ki-yi!' Well I knew that as long as that noise
kept up, I might as well be running out in the open
in full view, so I checked my pace a little, and the
Dog, with more pluck than good sense, laid me by
the ear. With one rip of my tusk sideways, I cast
him open from end to end. But such matters take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
some time, and check one when the run is close, and
before I could take to cover again, a Pony was fair
on top of me.</p>

<p>"I jinked, as only a Boar who has been in many
a run knows how. My jink was so sudden that the
rider, seeking to spear me under his Pony's neck,
came a full cropper in the black cotton-earth.
Ugh-huh-huh! it makes me laugh now when I think
of it. Of course I hadn't time to laugh then, for I
had no sooner jinked clear of his spear than I saw
coming up on the other side, the longest one of the
Men-kind that was ever in the Jungle, and what
with his spear he seemed like a tree. At once I
remembered what my Mother had told me to do if
ever a Spear-hunter got full on top of me. 'Into
the horse's legs,' the old Dame had said; 'that's
your only hope.' I must say that I charged Bagh
that other time with greater joy than I slashed into
that long Sahib's Pony.</p>

<p>"Of course, the Hunter thought I was going to
run for it, so when I jinked short about and ripped
his Pony's foreleg the full length of my nose, he
was taken quite off his guard.</p>

<p>"It seemed as though part of the Jungle had
fallen on me, for Pony and Huntman came down
like ripe fruit off the Mowha tree. I got one rip
at the Man's leg, and thought I'd made a fine cut,
but I learned afterward, after they'd caught me,
of course, that it was his boot-leg I had
ripped&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

</div>

<p>"Oh, Sa'-zada, I believe the Seoni Boar is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
best liar we've struck yet," said Magh.</p>

<p>"Not so," declared the Keeper, "this tale of the
pig-sticking is a true tale, for it is written in The
Book."</p>

<p>"I only tell that which is true," declared Big
Tusk, the Seoni Boar. "And before I had got to
the Scrub-Jungle, I had a spear driven into my
shoulder from another Sahib, but I put my teeth
through the giver's foot as I knocked his pony over
from the side. It was a rare fight that day, but
I got away at last."</p>

<p>"How were you caught?" queried Magh.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was long afterwards, and happened
because of Bagh's evil ways. The Huntman had
spread a big net in the Jungle to take Bagh, who
had slain a Woman; and in the drive, not knowing
of this evil thing, I came full into the net, and got
so tangled up that I could not move. When the
White Hunter saw that it was I, the Seoni Boar,
he said, 'Let us take him alive, for he has given us
mighty sport and fought well.' So they made a
cage and I was forced into it from the net."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Magh.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Boar.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the Orang-Outang, "from
your own account you appear to be a very fine fellow.
I can't understand why all the Jungle Dwellers,
even the Men-kind, connect your name with
everything that's evil. I doubt if one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
could speak as well for himself, were he allowed
to tell his own story."</p>

<p>"As I have said before," commented Sa'-zada,
"it's hardly fair to give an animal a bad name
without knowing all about him, and Boar's stories
have all been true, I know. But it's late now, so
each one away to his cage or corral, and sleep."</p>

THE STORIES OF OOHOO, THE WOLF,<br />
AND SHER ABI, THE CROCODILE</h2>


<p>"To-night," said Sa'-zada, the Keeper,
"we shall have a story from White
Wolf of his home in the frozen North, and also
one from Sher Abi, the Crocodile, of the warm
land in which he lived, Burma."</p>

<p>"I am glad there is to be a tale of the North-land,"
said Mooswa, "for it's a lovely place."</p>

<p>"And Sher Abi is so stupid," added Magh the
Orang, "that he's sure to fall to boasting of some
of his murders."</p>

<p>"There's little to choose between them in that
respect," commented Muskwa, "except that for
cunning there is no one but Carcajou of the same
wit as Wolf."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Comrade," cried Oohoo, the Arctic
Wolf; "those of my land who are short of wit go
with a lean stomach, I can tell you. But yet it is
just the sweetest place that any poor animal ever
lived in."</p>

<p>"It is," concurred Mooswa; "forests of green
Spruce trees&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so, Brother Tangle-leg," objected Oohoo;
"true I have been within the Timber Boundaries,
but that was far to the south of my home. I remember,
once upon a time, thinking to better my
condition, for it was a year of scarce Caribou; I
trailed down past Great Slave Lake to the home
of my cousin, Blue Wolf, who was Pack Leader of
the Timber Wolves. Ghurrh-h! but they led a
busy life. Almost day and night they were on the
hunt, for their kill was small; a Grey Rabbit, or
a Grouse, or a Marten&mdash;a mere mouthful for a
full-hungered Wolf.</p>

<p>"But in the Northland where one could travel
for days and days over the white snow and the hunt
meant a free run with no chance of cover for the
prey, it was all a matter of strength and speed.
Leopard has boasted of the merit of his spotted
coat for hiding in the sun-splashed Jungle; and
also Bagh has told how the stripes on his sides hide
him in the strong grass. But look at me, my Comrades&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are pretty," sneered Magh.</p>

<p>"Here I am dirty brown," resumed Oohoo, paying
no attention to the taunt, "and what does that
mean?"</p>

<p>"That you are dirty and a Wolf," answered
Magh, innocently.</p>

<p>"It shows that I live in a dirty brown place,"
asserted Wolf. "We are all dirty brown here."</p>

<p>"I'm not," objected Python.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would be if you didn't lie in the water all
day; but, as I was going to say, in that land of snow
I was all white, and, by my cunning, with a careful
stalk I always got within a running distance of&mdash;of&mdash;I
mean anything I wanted to look at closely,
you know."</p>

<p>"A Babe Caribou, I suppose," grunted Muskwa;
"just to see how he was coming on. Have I not
said that he has the cunning of a great thief?"
Bear whispered to Hathi.</p>

<p>"But if he talks much the truth will come out,"
answered the Elephant.</p>

<p>"There were just three of us Plain Dwellers in
all that great Barren Land," proceeded Oohoo;
"my kind, and Caribou, and Musk-Ox."</p>

<p>"Eu-yah! the Musk-Ox are cousins of mine," remarked
Bison. "Queer taste they have to live in
that terrible land of rock and snow. What do they
eat, Oohoo? Surely the sweet Buffalo Grass does
not grow there?"</p>

<p>"They do not mind the cold," answered Wolf;
"they have the loveliest long black hair you ever
saw on any Animal. And under that again is the
soft grey fur&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Sa'-zada to explain, "the
Musk-Ox seems to have hair, and fur, and wool all
on one pelt&mdash;much like a Sheep, and a Goat, and
a Bison combined."</p>

<p>"And as for eating," resumed Oohoo, the Wolf,
"the rocks are thickly covered with moss&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Engh-h-h! what a diet!" grunted Bison. "But
you know of their manner of life, Brother Wolf&mdash;you
must have paid much attention to their ways.
Now in my land when Wolves came too close we
gathered our Calves in the center of the herd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A most wise precaution," asserted Mooswa.
"In the Calf time with us the moan of the Wolf
pack caused us to make ready for battle; the Grey
Runners seemed always in the way of a great hunger."</p>

<p>"And what of grass-eating for those cousins of
mine, the Caribou&mdash;what ate they?" sharply demanded
Elk.</p>

<p>"Caribou have this manner of life," answered
Oohoo. "Just at the end of the great Cold Time
all the Mothers go far into the Northland, for that
is the Calf time with them; and by the shores of
the great Northland water their Babe Caribou come
forth in peace. And for food the Mothers eat moss,
even as Musk-Ox does, for there is nothing else.
Near to the coming of the Cold Time again the
Mothers come back with their Calves, and the
Bulls, who have been in the Southland, meet them."</p>

<p>"Do you eat moss, Oohoo, the Wolf?" queried
Magh.</p>

<p>"Am I a Grass-feeder? Did I eat my straw
bedding and become ill, like a wide-mouthed
Monkey that I know of?"</p>

<p>"But have you not said, Brother Wolf, that in
the Northland Musk-Ox and Caribou eat moss because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
there is nothing else? Then what manner of
food do you find?"</p>

<p>"Ghurr-r-h! Eh, what?" gasped Oohoo, feeling
that Magh had laid bare his mode of life.</p>

<p>"Am I different from the others?" he snarled,
seeing a broad grin hovering about the mouth of
even Sher Abi, the Crocodile. "Because I am a
Wolf, is there a law in the Boundaries that I shall
not eat? Bagh, and Pardus, and Python, and Sher
Abi, they are the Blood Kind, and do they eat moss
or grass? Boar has said that all the evil of the
Jungle is fastened upon the Pig, and in my land it
is the Wolf that is wicked. This has been said by
the Man, but are they not worse than we are?
When the hunger, which is not of my desire, comes
strong upon me, I go forth to seek food. I kill not
Man; but if Caribou comes my way, and that which
is inside of me says to make a kill, shall I do so,
or lie down and die because of hunger? If a Wolf
makes a kill, and feasts until his hunger is dead,
and lies down to sleep, and kills no more until he is
again hungered, it is all wrong, and evil words are
spoken of him. But the Men kill, and kill, never
stopping to eat, showing that it is not because of
hunger&mdash;they kill until there is no living thing left;
then they boast together of the slaughter.</p>

<p>"I have seen this happening at Fond du Lac,
which is a narrow crossing between two lakes in
my own land. There the Caribou pass when they
go to the Northland; and I have seen the Redmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
killing these Moss-eaters as they swam from land
to land&mdash;killing them beyond all count. In the
Northland the Caribou were even as Buffalo on the
Plains, they were that many; and they came like a
running river to the crossing at Fond du Lac. The
Men-kind were hidden behind stones, and when the
Caribou were in the water these Red Slayers followed
in canoes, and killed with their spears, and
their knives, and their guns, until everything was
red with blood. Not that they needed the sweet
flesh because of hunger, for from many they took
out the tongue, and left all the rest to rot. We,
who are Wolves, and of evil repute, are not so bad
as the Men, I think.</p>

<p>"And also the killing of the Musk-Ox is by the
Redmen," declared Oohoo.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we must believe that," muttered
Magh, "for Musk-Ox is not here, and it is a long
way to the Northland for proof."</p>

<p>"Neither here nor in any other animal city are
there Musk-Ox," explained Sa'-zada; "for none
have been brought out alive."</p>

<p>"None!" added Wolf solemnly. "The Redmen
say that if any are taken alive the others will
all pass to some other land as did Buffalo. Not but
that one of the White Men tried it once; but there
is also a story of Head-taking I could tell."</p>

<p>"Tell it," snapped Pardus; "one lie is as good as
another when told of a distant Jungle."</p>

<p>"Well I remember that year," began Oohoo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
"It was colder than any other time that I have
memory of. We had gathered into a mighty Pack,
Comrades; all white we were&mdash;all but our Leader,
who was Black Wolf. And such hunger! E-u-uh,
au-uh! I was almost blind because of the hunger
pains.</p>

<p>"The Caribou that should have passed did not
come; why, I cannot say, for it was their time of
the year, the ending of the Cold Time."</p>

<p>"Were there no Musk-Ox?" insinuated
Magh.</p>

<p>"A Wolf can make few kills of Musk-Ox," explained
Oohoo, unguardedly; "that is&mdash;I mean&mdash;a
bad Wolf who might seek a Kill of that sort. They
are like Bison, or Arna, bunching up close in a pack
with their big-horned heads all facing out; and even
if the circle is broken, what then? their fur is so
thick that it would take longer jaws than I have to
cut a throat."</p>

<p>"You've tried it, Oohoo," suggested Magh.</p>

<p>"No, I've heard of this matter," he answered.
"But the story was this way. That time two White
Men came to the Big Lake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Artillery Lake, I think," explained Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"I know not, but it is a Big Water, and far
north. And there they built a shack."</p>

<p>"You were interested," remarked Muskwa.</p>

<p>"There were cousins of ours, the Train Dogs,
with them, so I sometimes went close for the chance
of a chat&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"The chance of a Pup, most likely," growled
Gidar.</p>

<p>"Then one Man, with two Redmen and the Dog
Train, went north after Musk-Ox. Some of us
followed, for we knew that where the Men were
there would be much killing, and much eating left
for those of a lean stomach. It might be that some
of the Dogs would die of toil, and we were that
hungry, that starved, that even a Huskie would be
sweet eating.</p>

<p>"As you know, Comrades, there is no timber
grows in all that land beyond the Big Lake, so the
Man carried a little wood in the Dog Sled to make
hot his drinking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tea," suggested Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"Day after day he tramped to the North, not
seeing anything to kill; and all the time we were
getting hungrier and leaner of stomach. At night
we would come close to the little tepee wherein the
Hunter slept, and I fear that something would have
happened to him if it had not been for the wisdom
of our Leader, Black Wolf.</p>

<p>"'Wait, Pack Comrades,' he would say, 'there
will surely be a kill of many Musk-Ox. I know
the way of the White Men&mdash;they come here but
for the shedding of blood.'</p>

<p>"But one night, being close to the edge of starvation,
seeing one of the Huskies come forth from
the tepee, not knowing what I did&mdash;Ghur-rh! I
had him by the throat. Even now as I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
it, perhaps it was another of the Pack that put his
strong jaws on the Dog's gullet&mdash;yes, I think it was
another.</p>

<p>"'Ki, yi-i-i-i! E-e-eh!' he whined.</p>

<p>"'Buh!' loud the Firestick barked as the White
Man smote at the Pack with it.</p>

<p>"After a manner there was some eating that
night, what with the Huskie and three of our kind
the Man slew with the Firestick."</p>

<p>"Cannibal!" exclaimed Magh in disgust.</p>

<p>"It was to save our lives," exclaimed Oohoo.
"At last the White Man came to a herd of Musk-Ox;
but what think you of the temper Black Wolf
had when he saw that the Men-kind were not for
making a big Kill at all; just the matter of a Head
or two to take back with them."</p>

<p>"Queer taste, sure enough," cried Cockatoo.
"Now, if it had been a head with a crest like
mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or even if it had been Magh's head," insinuated
Pardus.</p>

<p>"Eu-wh, eu-u-u-h! to think that a Pack of famished
Wolves had trailed so far through the snow,
holding back from a Kill of the Men-kind, and to
get&mdash;nothing! True, the Men killed for their own
eating and the Dogs', but what was that to a whole
Pack? Buh-h-h! even now it makes me laugh when
I think of the manner we tore down the tepee one
night, for the Men had taken the eating inside to
keep it from us.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"After that, having learned wisdom, they killed
one of these fat creatures for us each day. Ghurrh!
but a bite!</p>

<p>"And from listening beside the tepee at night, I
learned that the Redmen were angry because of
the Head-taking. These Forest-Dwellers think,
Comrades, that if they sell or give away the
head of a Kill all their strength in the hunt will
depart."</p>

<p>"It's a wondrous good thing to believe, too," declared
Coyote. "Many an honest meal I've come
by when I was woefully hungry through the matter
of a head stuck on a pole, or stump, as a gift to
Matchi-Manitou. I remember one particularly fat
head of Muskwa&mdash;I mean&mdash;but you were saying,
Brother Oohoo, a most interesting happening of
the Musk-Ox when I interrupted you."</p>

<p>"So, when the Redmen knew that it was heads
their White Comrade was after, they were filled
with anger, and a fear of the wrath of Manitou;
they declared that something of an evil nature
would happen to them if he took from that land
the Heads. And, would you believe it, Comrades,
whether there was truth in the power of this Head-matter
or not, I am unable to say, being but Oohoo
the Wolf, but two days from that time, as they
journeyed back toward the Big Water, they fell in
with a large Herd of the round-nosed Musk-Ox,
and the Wind wrath came upon them. The Redmen,
thinking to stop the taking of Heads, talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to the Moss-eaters in a loud voice, as though they
were men, bidding them go far over the Barren
Lands and tell all the other Musk-Ox to keep away,
for here was a taker of Heads. But the White
Man only laughed, and killed a Bull Leader who
had a beautiful long black beard, swearing that
such a Head was a prize indeed.</p>

<p>"Comrades, perhaps there is someone looking
over the lives of Animals who has power with the
Wind and the White Storm. Of this I know not,
but it is a true tale that even as he cut the head
from the dead Moss-eater, such a storm as had not
been in the memory of any Dweller came with the
full fury of a hungry Wolf Pack down upon that
land. Like Pups of one litter all of us Wolves huddled
together, pulling the cover of our tails over
our noses to keep the heat in. We waited; and
moved not that day, nor that night, nor the next
day, nor the night after that again. Bitter as the
storm was, I almost laughed at Black Wolf's
lament. 'Now the men will be dead and lost to
us when we might have had them,' he kept whimpering;
'there will be no more killing of Musk-Ox,
and we shall go hungry.'</p>

<p>"As we crawled out when the storm ceased, our
Leader went to where the snow was rounded up a
little higher than the rest. 'Here is the Musk-Ox,'
said Black Wolf; 'let us eat.'</p>

<p>"I remember, as we dug at the snow there was a
strong scent of Man. 'It is the Hunter dead, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
think,' Black Wolf said, poking his nose down into
the snow.</p>

<p>"But all at once, 'Buh!' came a hoarse call from
the Firestick, and Black Wolf, our Leader,
'E-e-he-uh!' fell over backward, dead. Then I
knew what it was. The Huntman had cut open
the Musk-Ox, and crawling inside, had kept his life
warm through the fierce storm. But the Redmen
had gone. Whether they had died because of the
storm, or trailed away because of the Head-taking,
I know not; but there they were not. Close curled
against the Musk-Ox had lain the Hunter's three
Dogs, and they, too, were alive.</p>

<p>"Then commenced such a trail of a Man, Comrades,
as I, Wolf though I am, never wish to see
again. E-u-uh! eu-u-uh! but it was dreadful, for in
his face there was the Fear Look that Hathi has
spoken of. Night and day it was there, I think,
for he dared not sleep as he hurried back toward
the Big Water. Being without a Leader, we were
like a lot of Monkeys, fighting and jangling
amongst ourselves. Some were for killing him, but
others said, 'Wait, surely he will make a kill of
Musk-Ox again, and then we shall have eating&mdash;what
is one Man to a Wolf Pack in the way of
food?'</p>

<p>"That day, coming up with a Herd, he shot two
of the Moss-eaters, and, as we ate of them, he
trailed to the South; but that availed him little,
Comrades, for the swing of a Wolf's going is like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the run of a river; and when he camped that night
we also camped there. And the next day, and the
next, it was the same; the Huntman pushing on
with tiring walk striving for his life, and, behind
the Pack&mdash;some howling for a Kill of the Man,
and some fighting to save him that we might have
greater eating.</p>

<p>"It was the last day before we came to the Big
Water. That day, being full famished, for we had
passed the land of the Musk-Ox&mdash;though to be sure
he had killed two Caribou for us&mdash;we ate his Dogs,
and he was fleeing on foot.</p>

<p>"I must say, Comrades, though I lay no claim to
a sweet nature, yet I wished not to make a Kill of
the Man. But five times, as I remember it, some
of the Pack, eager for his life, closed in on him;
and five times with the Firestick he slew many of
my Wolf Brethren. Comrades, he made a brave
fight to reach the shack."</p>

<p>"This is a terrible tale," cried Magh, excitedly.
"Did he reach the shack alive, Oohoo?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but would you believe it, Comrades, the
White Man who had been left behind, through
being alone and through drinking much Firewater,
had become mad, even as I have seen a Wolf in the
time of great heat; and he knew not his Comrade,
the Huntman, but called through the closed door,
'Go away, go away!'</p>

<p>"'I am Jack,' called the Huntman.</p>

<p>"'Jack is dead!' yelped the Man who was mad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
'He is dead out in the strong storm, and you are an
evil spirit&mdash;go away! go away!'</p>

<p>"Oh, Hathi, it was dreadful, dreadful.</p>

<p>"'Let me in, Tom; I am Jack,' pleaded the
Huntman who had come so far through the snow;
and, just beyond, we of the Wolf Pack waited,
waited, waited.</p>

<p>"Sa'-zada, the cry of the lone Wolf is not so
dreadful as the yelpings of the Man who was mad.
Even we of the Wolf Pack moved back a little
when he called with a fierce voice. And he always
answered: 'Go away! You are an evil spirit. Jack
is dead! But I did not kill him&mdash;Go away!' And,
Sa'-zada, though it is dreadful, yet it is true, he
struck with his Firestick full through the door, and
killed the Man who was Jack. And in the end he,
too, died, and the Wolves buried them both after
the manner of Wolves."</p>

<p>"Chee-hough! it's a terrible tale," said Magh.</p>

<p>"It is true," answered White Wolf; "and all
that is the way of my land which is the Northland.</p>

<p>"In the Hot Time sometimes there are the
little red flowers that are roses, but in the long
Cold Time it is as I have said, cold and a land
of much hunger. But it is my land&mdash;the Northland."</p>

<p>"Engh-h-hu!" sighed Sher Abi, opening his eyes
as though just coming out of a dream; "I had an
experience one time very much like that, Brother
Wolf."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of a snow storm, Sher Abi?" queried Mooswa,
doubtingly.</p>

<p>"No, my solemn friend, I know nothing of snow;
I speak of having a Man inside of one. As Sa'-zada
has said, I think it's quite possible, and I'm
sure they must rest nice and warm, too."</p>

<p>"Did a Man cut you open, Magar?" sneered
Magh.</p>

<p>"No, little Old Woman, he did not; he was busy
that day taking off your tail for stealing his plantains."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, Magar," lisped Python.
"Wolf's tale of his snow-land makes me shiver."</p>

<p>"There is not much to tell," murmured Sher
Abi, regretfully. "It was all over in a few minutes,
and all an accident, too; and, besides, it was
only one Man. You see, I was sunning myself on
a mud bank in Cherogeah Creek, when I heard
'thomp, thomp, thomp!' which was the sound of a
Boatman's paddle against the side of his log dug-out.
I slid backward into the water, keeping just
one eye above it to see what manner of traveler it
might be. It was old Lahbo, a villager who often
went up and down that creek, so I started to swim
across, meaning to come up alongside of his canoe
and wish him the favor of Buddha. As you know,
Comrades, all Animals love these Buddhists, for
their Master has taught them not to take the life of
any Jungle Dweller.</p>

<p>"As I have said, I was swimming across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
creek, when Lahbo, who must have been asleep,
suddenly ran his canoe up on my back. It was such
a light little dug-out, too, quite narrow, and being
suddenly startled, I jumped, and by some means
Lahbo's canoe was upset. Poor old Lahbo! How
my heart ached for him when I heard him scream
in the water."</p>

<p>"Oh, the evil liar!" whispered Magh in Hathi's
ear.</p>

<p>"Hush-h!" whistled Elephant, softly, through
his trunk; "Sher Abi was ever like this; I know
him well. It is just his way of boasting; he knows
nobody believes it."</p>

<p>"Poor Lahbo," continued Magar. "I swam
quickly to help him, picked him up tenderly in my
jaws, and started for the shore. I would have
saved his life in another minute, but his cries had
gone to the ears of some Villagers, and they were
now on the bank of the creek, and with two Firesticks,
also. I was in a terrible fix, Comrades; if
I held my head under water, poor Lahbo would
drown; if I held it up, the Village Men would kill
me with the Firestick."</p>

<p>"How did it end, Saver of Life?" asked Pardus.
"Did poor Lahbo ask you to swallow him to save
his life?"</p>

<p>"I really can't say what did happen," answered
Sher Abi. "To this day tears come into my eyes
when I think of poor Lahbo. And it was all the
fault of the Villagers, for when the Firestick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
coughed, I think the Man-fear, that Hathi has
spoken of, came over him, for he commenced to
wriggle about so that I couldn't hold him. I was
so careful, too, for my teeth are sharp, and I was
afraid of hurting him. But, anyway, before I knew
it, Ee-eh-he! he had slipped down my throat; poor
Lahbo! And do you know, Comrades, I'm a little
afraid I'm not done with him yet, for he had a big
two-handed dah (sword) in his waist-band, and
I know that some of the pains I feel at times are
due to that; there's nothing so hard to digest as a
Burmese dah. And to this day, Comrades, sometimes
when I'm jumping about it seems to me that
bangles and rings that are inside of me string themselves
on that sword&mdash;I fancy at times I can hear
them jingle."</p>

<p>"How did you come to have bangles inside of
you?" asked Magh most solicitously.</p>

<p>"Engh-hu! little Moon-face, you make me very
tired. If any one tells a tale you try to put false
words into his mouth."</p>

<p>"And bangles," snapped Magh.</p>

<p>"Who spoke of bangles?" asked Sher Abi. "I
said not that they were bangles, but that it was
like that&mdash;the pains I mean. Perhaps even Lahbo
dropped the dah overboard, for all I know. And
look here, little one, Moon-faced Languar, if you
doubt what I say, you may go inside and see for
yourself."</p>

<p>"How came you to this place, Sher Abi?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
asked Mooswa. "Did the Villagers catch you
then?"</p>

<p>"Not that time. But once, hearing a Pariah
Dog in great distress, I thought he called to me
for aid, even as poor Lahbo had done, so I swam
quickly to lend him help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor Dog," jeered Magh.</p>

<p>"But it was all a vile trick of the Men-kind,"
declared Magar; "though at the time, not knowing
of this, I paid no heed to the matter. There were
two long rows of stakes in the water coming close
together at one end&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lough-hu! I know," murmured Buffalo; "the
walls of a stockade."</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed Sher Abi. "And as I pushed
through the small end, the poor Dog being just
beyond, and in great distress, a big rope drew tight
about my neck, and before I could so much as
object, many of the Men-kind pulled me out on to
the dry land. Then I was sent here to Sa'-zada."</p>

<p>"Well, well," murmured Hathi, "it seems to me
that every Jungle-Dweller thinks he's badly
treated, but judging from all the tales I've heard
I think we've all got our faults&mdash;I think we're
nearly as bad as the Men-kind."</p>

<p>"My people are not," objected Buffalo; "we
never did harm to anyone."</p>

<p>"Neither did we," exclaimed Mooswa.</p>

<p>"Nor we," added Elk; and soon the clamor became
general, all holding that the Men-kind who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
killed almost every animal for the sake of taking
its life, and not because they were driven to it by
lean stomachs, were much worse than the Jungle-Dwellers.</p>

<p>"Well, well," decided Hathi, "it seems that most
of you are against me, anyway. I think Buffalo is
right in what he says, but some of us have done
much wrong to the Men-kind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meaning me, of course," ejaculated Wild Boar.
"I, who lay no claim to being good, and who am
counted the worst of all Animals, say, with Buffalo,
that the Men-kind have done more harm to me
than I to them, and have been of less benefit to me
than I to them."</p>

<p>Then Sa'-zada spoke: "Comrades, this is a question
that we can't settle. If we were all like the
Buddhists, and took no life except because of great
need, perhaps it would be better. But now you
must all go back to your cages and corrals to sleep."</p>

<h2><a name="TWELFTH_NIGHT" id="TWELFTH_NIGHT"></a><big>TWELFTH NIGHT</big><br /><br />

THE STORY OF SA'-ZADA, THE "ZOO" KEEPER</h2>


<p>It was the twelfth night of the Sa'-zada stories.
For eleven evenings Tiger, and Leopard, and
the others had told of their manner of life, with
more or less relevancy. This night Sa'-zada, the
little Master, was to speak of his jungle and forest
experience.</p>

<p>Magh, the Orang, was filled with a joyous anticipation.
Perched as usual on Hathi's broad forehead,
she gave expression to little squeaks of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Once even she stuck out her long, elastic under-lip
and broke into the little jungle song she always
had resource to when pleasantly excited:</p>

<p>"Co-oo-oo-oo-oo! Co-wough, wough-oo!" with
a rising inflection that made the listener's ears
tingle. She even danced a modest can-can on
Hathi's patient old head.</p>

<p>The Keeper came briskly up the walk, and patting
Hathi's trunk affectionately as it was held out
to him, sat on the grass with his back against Mooswa's
side.</p>

<p>"Well, Comrades," he commenced, "before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
came to a state of friendship with the Jungle Dwellers,
I was like a great many others of my kind, and
thought the only pleasure to be got from animals
was in killing them."</p>

<p>"It is the beginning of a true talk," commented
Pardus.</p>

<p>"And, so, in that time I hunted a great deal,"
continued Sa'-zada. "When I first went to Burma
to live, my bungalow was just on the edge of
the Jungle, and some of the Dwellers were always
forcing their presence upon me&mdash;either
Snakes, or Jackals, or Jaruk the Hyena, or the
Bandar-Log; and one night even a Rogue Elephant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hum-p-p-ph! he should have been prodded
with a sharp tusk," commented Hathi.</p>

<p>"A Rogue Elephant," continued Sa'-zada, "came
down and played basket-ball with my garden and
bamboo cook-house. Gidar the Jackal, with a
dozen companions, used to gut my kitchen, and
then sit out in the moonlight and howl at me in
derision."</p>

<p>"We sing at night because we can't help it, and
not because of ill will to the Men-kind," corrected
Gidar.</p>

<p>"Well, one night, as the Jackals were in the
middle of a heavy chorus, they suddenly ceased; a
silence as of death came over everything; it seemed
as though all life had gone miles away from that
part of the country. Then came a hoarse call which
shook my little bungalow&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know," interrupted Gidar, "when we stop
singing and move away silently it is to make room
for Bagh the Killer. We object to being seen in
the company of a murderer like that."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was Tiger," asserted Sa'-zada, "and
two Sahibs, who were my companions, and, like
myself, new to the country, determined to get
him.</p>

<p>"So next evening we took a Goat and tied it just
inside the Jungle, each one of us lying down on the
ground at a short distance from our bait. But the
Goat commenced to browse quietly and refused to
bleat. I tried jumping him up and down by the
tail and back of his neck, and he'd bleat just as
long as I'd pump. At last I tied him up so that
he stood on his hind legs, and he called then with
full vigor. For the matter of an hour we lay thus,
when presently, behind me, I heard the stealthy
step of some huge Jungle Dweller coming for the
Goat.</p>

<p>"It was the most deliberate animal I had ever
waited for; it seemed hours that those carefully
planted feet had been heading towards the back of
my head. I could see nothing, for I was facing the
other way, and I dared not turn over for fear of
frightening the approaching Tiger away. This is
a true tale, Comrades, and I did not like overmuch
the idea of Bagh or Pardus, whichever it might be,
pouncing upon me from behind."</p>

<p>"And they would do it," declared Gidar, "for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
there is a saying in their tribe that 'a kill from
behind is a kill of skill.'"</p>

<p>"Were you afraid, little Master?" asked
Hathi.</p>

<p>"I didn't like it," answered Sa'-zada, evasively.</p>

<p>"I've lain close hid in the Elephant Grass," said
Bagh, "when a mighty drive of the Sahibs was on;
and perhaps you felt that time, O Sa'-zada, even
as I did."</p>

<p>"I, too, have heard the Pigstickers galloping,
galloping all about a little <i>nulla</i> where I have
sought for safety and the chance of my life," added
Wild Boar, "and it's dreadful. If all the Sahibs
could have known that feeling, even as you
did, O Sa'-zada, perhaps they would hunt us
less."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," answered the Keeper; "but I could
hear the great animal creeping, oh, so carefully,
step by step, hardly a twig shifting under his cautious
feet&mdash;only a little soft rustle of the leaves as
they whispered to the sleepy night air that something
of evil was afoot. It got on my nerves, I
must say, for I knew that I had not one chance in
a thousand if Bagh were to spring upon me from
behind. A fair fight I did not mind. I dared not
even whisper to my companions, for they were a
short distance from me, lest I should frighten the
quarry away. When the soft-moving feet were
within five yards of my head they became silent,
and I felt that the great animal, Bagh or Pardus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
or some other Killer, was crouched ready for a
spring.</p>

<p>"One minute, two minutes, an hour&mdash;perhaps
half the night I seemed waiting for something to
happen. The suspense was dreadful. One of my
comrades had heard the footsteps, too, for I could
see his rifle gleam in the moonlight as he held it
ready to fire at sight of the animal. The strain
was so trying that I almost wished Bagh would
charge.</p>

<p>"But at last my nerves got the better of me and
I turned over on my face, bringing my Express up
to receive the visitor. The noise startled him, and
with a hoarse bark he was off into the Jungle. It
was only little ribbed-faced Barking Deer, who had
come out of curiosity to see what the Goat was
making a row about."</p>

<p>Hathi gave a great sigh of relief, for the Little
Master's story of thrilling danger had worked him
up to a pitch of excited interest.</p>

<p>"I remember a little tale of a happening," said
Arna the Buffalo. "We were a herd of at least
twenty, lying in a bit of nice, soft muddy land, for
it was a wondrous hot day, I remember, when suddenly
right through the midst of us walked a Sahib,
and with him was one of the Black Men-kind. By
his manner I knew that he had not seen us, being
half-buried as we were in the <i>jhil</i>. Just beyond
where we rested was a plain of the dry grass Eating,
and to that our enemies the Men passed. Comrades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the method of our doing you know, when
there is danger. If it is far away, and we see it,
we go quickly from its presence, as is right for all
Jungle Dwellers; but should it come suddenly close
upon us we fight with a strength that even Bagh
dreads.</p>

<p>"As I have said, seeing the Sahib so close,
our Leader sprang up and snorted in anger.
Now Bagh, when he is in an evil temper,
roars loudly; but we, being people of little
voice, trusting more to our horns than to noise,
only call 'Eng-ugh!' before we charge. So,
when our Leader called twice, we rushed out
into the field where was this Sahib. I remember
well, the Black man ran with great speed
across the Plain, but the Sahib faced us. In his
eyes there was a look such as I have seen in the
eyes of another Bull when I have challenged him,
and it was a question whether we should fight or
not.</p>

<p>"But fear came not to this Man," added Arna,
decidedly, "for as we raced down upon him, he
smote at us with his Firestick, and taking the cover
that was on his head&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His helmet," suggested Sa'-zada.</p>

<p>"The cover in his hand," proceeded Arna,
"charged full at us, calling us evil names in a loud
voice. I know not which of us turned in his gallop,
but certain it is that the herd passed on either side
of the Man and he was not hurt."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"But did you not turn and trample him?" asked
Boar.</p>

<p>"No," answered Arna; "when we charge we
charge, and there's an end of it."</p>

<p>"That is also our way," concurred Bagh, "except,
perhaps, when we are struck by the Firestick,
then sometimes we turn and charge back."</p>

<p>"By-the-memory-of-honey!" said Muskwa the
Bear, "I should like to hear a tale from Sa'-zada
of my people."</p>

<p>"Well," declared the Keeper, "there was a happening
in connection with Muskwa's cousin,
Grizzly, that makes me tremble&mdash;I mean, calls up
rather unpleasant memories to this day."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that&mdash;Whuf! glad we're to have
the story," corrected Muskwa, apologetically.</p>

<p>"It was in the Rocky Mountains," began Sa'-zada,
"in the South Kootenay Pass. I was after
Big Horn, the Mountain Sheep, with two Comrades,
and a guide called Eagle Child, when we
saw a big Grizzly coming down the side of a mountain
called the Camel's Back.</p>

<p>"Now, Eagle Child was a man very eager to do
big things, so, almost without asking my consent,
he laid out the whole plan of campaign. On the
side of the Camel's Back Mountain grew a spruce
forest, and through this snow avalanches had
ploughed roadways, from top to bottom, looking
like the streets of a city. Eagle Child called to
me as he forded the mountain stream on his Horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
that he would go up one of these snow roads and
get the Grizzly, or turn him down another one for
me.</p>

<p>"Now, Comrades, Muskwa here is a man of
peace, loving his honey and his Ants, but Grizzly
is one to interview with great caution, and my Comrade,
Eagle Child, being a man of unwise haste,
you will understand, Comrades, that I expected
strange happening when he started to interfere with
Grizzly's evening plans, for it was toward the end
of the day."</p>

<p>"It is not wise to meddle with one of a short
temper," declared Hathi.</p>

<p>"I am not one of a short temper," objected
Grizzly. "I seek a quarrel with no one; but, perhaps,
if this man, who was Sa'-zada's comrade,
sought to make a kill of one of our kind, there may
have been trouble. If I am of a great strength
why is that&mdash;is it so that I may be killed easily?
Have I not strong claws just as Bagh has his teeth,
and Boar his tusks, and Python his strength of
squeeze?&mdash;even also have I somewhat of a squeeze
myself. And shall I not use these things that I
have, as do the other Forest Dwellers when their
desire is to live? I am not like Elk that can gallop
fast&mdash;flee from a slayer. And so, if I, being strong,
fight for my life, it is temper, eh? Wough! I am
as I am. But go on, Little Master&mdash;tell us of this
happening."</p>

<p>"As I was saying," recommenced Sa'-zada,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
"when Eagle Child in his great eagerness started
after that Bear, I had an idea there would be fun,
and there was&mdash;though I must say that I followed
up to give him some help."</p>

<p>"There was no harm in that," said Grizzly,
magnanimously. "Comrades of the same kind
must help each other."</p>

<p>"That Eagle Child had ridden up to meet the
Grizzly was in itself a fair promise for excitement,
but also his Cayuse was one of the jerkiest brutes
ever ridden by anybody. He had a great dislike
for spurs."</p>

<p>"Quite right, too," bubbled Unt the Camel; "I
remember a Cavalry Man on my back once&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sa'-zada interrupted Camel, and continued: "A
dig from the spurs and the Cayuse would refuse to
budge; but, of course, the rider knew that.</p>

<p>"Eagle Child thought that the Bear was working
down in a certain direction, but, as you know, Comrades,
Muskwa is a fellow of many notions, turning
and twisting and changing his course beyond all
calculations."</p>

<p>"Yes, we are like that," assented Muskwa. "It
is our manner of life. We find our food in small
parts, and in many places&mdash;berries here, and Ants
there, and perhaps Honey on the other side. We
are not like Bagh, who goes straight for his Kill,
for we must keep a sharp lookout or we shall find
nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, Grizzly evidently turned, for, while my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Guide was looking for him in one direction, he
bounced out not ten yards from the Cayuse from
a totally different quarter. This rather startled
Eagle Child; and, though he should have known
better, he dug the silly spurs into his erratic tempered
Horse, with the result that the latter balked&mdash;bucked
up like a stubborn mule.</p>

<p>"This looked as though he meant to stop and
fight it out&mdash;the Grizzly evidently thought so, for
he gave a snort of rage and tore down the mountain
full at his enemy. I dared not shoot for fear
of striking my comrade; but one bullet wouldn't
have mattered, anyway; it wouldn't have stopped
the charging Grizzly. Luckily for Eagle Child,
his Horse reared just as the Bear arrived, and
though he was sent flying, Muskwa's cousin did
not succeed in clawing him, his time being taken up
in making little pieces of the Horse. Eagle Child
arrived at the foot of the mountain very rapidly,
for all this had happened at the top of a long shale
cut bank, and he did not look for smooth paths, but
just came away without regard to the means of
transport."</p>

<p>"And is that all of the tale?" inquired Magh,
with a rather disappointed air, for she had hoped
to hear of Muskwa's getting the worst of the encounter.</p>

<p>"Not by any means," answered Sa'-zada; "that
was but the beginning. My comrade being out of
the way," he continued, "I fired at Grizzly."</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"To kill him?" exclaimed Mooswa, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"That was before I was comrade to the Jungle
Dwellers," apologized the Keeper&mdash;"before I
knew they were more interesting alive than dead.
And I fear I struck him, too," he added, "for when
he had finished knocking the Horse to pieces we
saw him go up the side of the Camel's Back limping
as though a leg had been broken."</p>

<p>"That was a shame," declared Mooswa.</p>

<p>"It would have been a great shame, an outrage,"
asserted Bagh, "if I, or Pardus, or even Hathi
had broken the leg of a Man; we would have been
hunted by a drove of twenty Elephants, and many
of the Men-kind."</p>

<p>"But," objected Magh, "as Sa'-zada has said,
that was before he had proper wisdom, so we bear
him no malice. Even Muskwa does not, do you,
old Shaggy Sides?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not know the law of life then," said
the Keeper; "and Eagle Child and myself followed
after poor old wounded Grizzly and in our hearts
was a desire for his life. Eagle Child was cross
because I had laughed at him when he came down
all covered with mud, also he had lost a Horse.
He swore that he would kill that Bear if it took a
week."</p>

<p>"I know," commented Hathi, swinging his trunk
sideways and lifting Jaruk off his feet with a blow
in the ribs as if by accident. "I hate the smell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
that Jungle Scavenger," he confided to Magh in a
whisper. "I know," he continued aloud, "I've
heard the Sahibs swear often, over a less matter
than the killing of a Horse, too."</p>

<p>"We thought that Grizzly was badly wounded
and couldn't go far, and that we should soon come
within range of him up amongst the rocks."</p>

<p>"Of course, he went up, having a broken leg,"
declared Pardus; "that's the way with all Forest
Dwellers&mdash;one pitches going down on three legs."</p>

<p>"But it was getting late, so we hurried fast. I
had tied my Horse to a tree, for the climb was
steep. Up, up, up we went; sometimes catching
sight of Grizzly, sometimes seeing a drop of
blood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dreadful," whimpered Mooswa. "Why
should Men be so eager to see the blood of Forest
Dwellers who have not harmed them?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes we saw blood on the rocks," proceeded
Sa'-zada, "and sometimes we followed
Grizzly's trail by the mark of a stone upturned
where his strong claws had been planted. Once
I got another shot at him, and struck him, too, but,
as Greybeard here might tell you, a Grizzly is like
Arna, he can carry off the matter of twenty bullets
unless they happen upon his heart or brain."</p>

<p>"That is even so," concurred Grizzly. "Whuff!
I have at least a dozen in my own body. The Men
seek to improve our tempers after that manner."</p>

<p>"It was getting late," resumed Sa'-zada, "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
still we continued upward, the Bear holding on with
great strength. It was October, and in the hollows
of the upper ranges snow was lying like a white
apron in a nurse's lap. 'He went this way,' said
the guide to me, pointing to a narrow ledge of rock
around the side of a cliff, with a drop from it of a
thousand feet.</p>

<p>"Now, Eagle Child was a Stony Indian, and
they are like Mountain Sheep in their ability to
climb. We had to work our way down carefully
to this ledge, helping each other lest we fall, and
even when it was reached the yawn of the valley
a thousand feet below caused me to tremble. So,
cautiously we worked along this narrow path, and,
as we rounded the point, to our great fear we saw
that we could go no farther&mdash;a dead wall stood
two hundred feet high in front of us. Slowly, cautiously,
we turned our bodies, and went back; and
then we saw what we had overlooked in our eagerness
for poor old Grizzly's life&mdash;we could not get
up the way we had come down&mdash;we were trapped."</p>

<p>"It's a dreadful feeling," declared Pardus, "to
be caught in a Trap&mdash;though there were no Men
enemies about you, Sa'-zada, to make it worse."</p>

<p>"Or to be shut up in a Keddah," muttered Hathi&mdash;"it's
awful. To be taken out of one's nice pleasant
jungle and led into a Keddah trap with those of
the Men-kind trumpeting and calling, and even
those of our own tribe, Elephant, taking part
against us."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was that what made you friend to the Jungle
Dwellers, Sa'-zada?" asked Muskwa.</p>

<p>"At the time," answered the Keeper, "I thought
only of the dreadful fix we were in. Below, a
thousand feet or more, the sharp tops of the spruce
and cedar stood like spears&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've felt a spear in my shoulder, ugh, ugh! it
drives one fair mad with fear and pain," grunted
Boar.</p>

<p>"Under our feet was a narrow ledge of rock not
the width of Hathi's back; behind us, and on either
side of us, the cliffs ran up hundreds of feet. On
the upper peak of the Camel's Back a snowstorm
was shutting out the last grey light of day&mdash;the
darkness of night was fast coming on. I could see
nothing for it but to stand perfectly straight with
our backs to the rock wall all through the bitter
night and talk to each other to keep sleep away.
The next day our comrades might find us, and let
down a rope to help us up."</p>

<p>"You could also think in the night of how we
feel, O Little Brother, when we are hunted," declared
Pardus. "Even perhaps Grizzly with his
broken leg had to lie on some rock, afraid to travel
in the night lest he fall."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a good time to think of the troubles
of Jungle Dwellers," concurred Hathi.</p>

<p>"I thought of many things," said the Keeper,
softly; "and but for Eagle Child I fear I should
have fallen a dozen times; I felt his hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
my arm more than once pressing me against the
wall. But at last morning came. I never felt
so cold in my life, for, you see, we dared not
move about. But it was noon before I saw
my two comrades riding up the valley looking for
us.</p>

<p>"Eagle Child called, 'Hi, yi, yi&mdash;oh, yi!' The
rocks threw his voice far out, and they heard it. It
took them a long time to climb up to the place from
where we had descended. They had brought their
lassos with them, for they knew that we were cut
off; and soon, but with much cautious labor, we
were safe."</p>

<p>"And what of Grizzy?" asked Muskwa, solicitously.</p>

<p>"I hope he, too, got away all right," answered
Sa'-zada, "for I never saw him again&mdash;we did not
follow him."</p>

<p>"I think Wie-sah-ke-chack led you to that place,
Little Master, to give Grizzly a chance for his
life," commented Mooswa.</p>

<p>"I like our Master's story," declared Hathi;
"so often I've heard the Sahibs boasting of the
Animals they have killed, but Sa'-zada tells only of
the times fear came to him because of his wrong-doing."</p>

<p>"That happening was of Greybeard, and he is
but a cousin of mine," complained Muskwa the
Black Bear. "Did you never meet with my family,
Little Master?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you insist upon it, Muskwa," answered
the Keeper, "I might tell a little tale of your
people."</p>

<p>"I should like that&mdash;do," pleaded Black Bear;
"in all the stories there has been nothing of our
doing."</p>

<p>"But they were also only relatives of yours,
though they were black, for the happening was in
India, and there they are called Bhalu the Bear.
And the happening was not of my doing, either,
for I was hunting Bagh, the Tiger."</p>

<p>"Every hunter takes me for a choice," growled
Raj Bagh.</p>

<p>"But this was a bad Tiger," declared Sa'-zada;
"he had killed many people."</p>

<p>"And what of that&mdash;Waugh-houk! what of that,
Little Master?" demanded Raj Bagh. "Have not
many people killed many of my kind&mdash;are they not
always killing us?"</p>

<p>"Still the Little Master is right," objected
Hathi. "If a Bull Elephant becomes Rogue, and,
neglecting his proper eating which is in the Jungle,
goes seeking to kill the Men-kind, does he not
surely come into trouble?"</p>

<p>"But we be flesh eaters and slayers of life," answered
Raj Bagh.</p>

<p>"Even so, though that were better otherwise, but
do you not know of your own people that the Men-kind
are not for Kill? Before all other Dwellers
of the Jungle you stand forth and are ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
battle, but just the <i>scent</i> of Man causes you to slink
away like Jaruk the Hyena."</p>

<p>"I think that is true," commented Mooswa.
"Wie-sah-ke-chack has arranged all that."</p>

<p>Said the Keeper: "It is not right to kill the animals
as men do, for sport, but when Bagh, or any
other Jungle Dweller, turns Man-eater, he should
die."</p>

<p>"And Sher Abi, too," squeaked Magh; "his
tribe are all Man-eaters&mdash;they should be all
killed."</p>

<p>"At any rate," continued the Keeper, "I was
after this Man-eater. I had a <i>machan</i> built in a
Pipal tree, and a Buffalo calf tied up near it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One of your young, Arna," said Bagh, vindictively.</p>

<p>"And early in the evening I climbed into my
<i>machan</i> and prepared for Mister Stripes."</p>

<p>"That's Man's way," sneered Raj Bagh.
"What chance have we against them up in
a <i>machan</i>? No chance; and they call that
sport."</p>

<p>"And what chance has a village woman against
a big-fanged Tiger?" grunted Boar. "No chance.
It seems to me there are few in the Jungle as decent
as Hathi and myself; we meddle not with the
Men."</p>

<p>"Just before dark," continued Sa'-zada, "I heard
a noise coming through the Khir bushes. 'Bagh
comes early,' I thought to myself."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"He must have been hungry to scent a kill before
dark," muttered Raj Bagh.</p>

<p>"He smelt a man and thought it a good chance
to commit murder," sneered Magh.</p>

<p>"It wasn't Tiger at all," said the Keeper, "but
three noisy Black Bears&mdash;Bhalu the Bear. I
thought they would soon pass, for they do not meddle
much with cattle."</p>

<p>"No, we are not throat cutters like Bagh,"
whuffed Muskwa.</p>

<p>"But they seemed in an inquisitive mood. Now,
the calf was tied to the foot of a toddy palm, and
they looked at him as much as to say, 'What are
you doing here?'"</p>

<p>"I would have explained matters to them had I
been there," exclaimed Arna, shaking his head.
"A poor Calf!"</p>

<p>"No doubt they meant to help him out of his
trouble," volunteered Muskwa.</p>

<p>"Presently one of them proceeded to climb the
toddy palm, and I thought they were looking for
me perhaps. On the tree was a jar the natives had
put there for catching the toddy liquor; and you can
imagine my surprise, Comrades, when I saw Bhalu
take a big drink out of this. When he came down
one of his comrades went up. There were half-a-dozen
toddy trees there, and the Bears helped
themselves to the toddy until in the end they became
very drunk."</p>

<p>"I know how that feels," said Oungea the Water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Monkey; "have I not told you, Comrades, of the
gin my Master&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Caw-w-w, caw-w-w!" interrupted Crow. "I
also know of that condition. I ate some cherries
once that had been thrown from a bungalow in
Calcutta, and they made my head wobble so I
couldn't fly. A Sahib stood in the door and laughed
and said I was drunk."</p>

<p>"The cherries had been in brandy, I suppose,"
explained Sa'-zada. "But Bhalu was most unmistakably
drunk. They wanted to play with the Calf,
but he became frightened and bawled. I could see
there was small chance of a visit from Bagh with
three drunken Bears and a bellowing Calf at the
foot of my tree."</p>

<p>"This is a nice story, Muskwa," sneered Magh.
"I'm so glad to hear of your people and their
ways."</p>

<p>"Only cousins of mine," declared Muskwa, "and
called Bhalu."</p>

<p>"All Bears are alike," snapped Coyote; "meddlesome
thieves."</p>

<p>"They steal little Pigs," added Boar.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't go away," said Sa'-zada, "and
I began to fear that I shouldn't get a shot at
Stripes. I did not want to shoot, because if Tiger
was anywhere in the neighborhood it would put an
end to his visit. I had nothing heavy to throw at
them except my water-bottle; but, finally, taking a
long drink to keep the thirst away for a time, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
stood up in the <i>machan</i> and let fly the bottle.
It caught the Bear just behind the ear, and
Bhalu, thinking one of his comrades had hurt
him, pitched into the other two, and there
was a fierce three-cornered fight on in a minute."</p>

<p>"I can swear that it is a true tale," barked Gidar,
"for twice I've seen a family of Bhalu's people in
just such a stupid fight. Not that they were possessed
of toddy, for they are silly enough at all
times. But it is known in the Jungle that when
Bhalu is wounded, he fights with the first one he
sees, even his own brother, thinking he has done
him the harm."</p>

<p>"One chap got the worst of the encounter and
reeled off into the Jungle, the other two following.
I could hear them wrangling and snarling for a
long distance&mdash;all the world like a party of
drunken sailors."</p>

<p>"These Bear stories are just lovely," grinned
Magh. "Aren't they, Muskwa?"</p>

<p>"Did you kill Bagh, the Man-eater?" asked
Muskwa, to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Yes, I stopped his murderous career that
night," answered Sa'-zada. "He was an evil animal
and deserved to die. Now it is late and you
must all go to your cages."</p>

<p>"I'm glad your people had a chance to be heard
from, Muskwa," lisped Magh as she slid down
Hathi's trunk. "You always looked so terribly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
respectable and honest, that I was really afraid
to speak to you."</p>

trunk; "I have lived for a matter of forty years or
so, amongst the Jungle Dwellers and with the Men-kind,
and I think that we are all alike, all having
some good and some bad qualities."</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
